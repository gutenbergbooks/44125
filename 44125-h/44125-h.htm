<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the first English translation of the complete
works of Polybius as far as they are now known. In
attempting such a task I feel that I ought to state
distinctly the limits which I have proposed to myself
in carrying it out. I have desired to present to
English readers a faithful copy of what Polybius
wrote, which should at the same time be a readable
English book. I have not been careful to follow the
Greek idiom; and have not hesitated to break up
and curtail or enlarge his sentences, when I thought
that, by doing so, I could present his meaning in more
idiomatic English. Polybius is not an author likely to
be studied for the sake of his Greek, except by a few
technical scholars; and the modern complexion of much
of his thought makes such a plan of translation both
possible and desirable. How far I have succeeded I
must leave my readers to decide. Again, I have not
undertaken to write a commentary on Polybius, nor to
discuss at length the many questions of interest which
arise from his text. Such an undertaking would have
required much more space than I was able to give: and
happily, while my translation was passing through the
press, two books have appeared, which will supply
English students with much that I might have felt
bound to endeavour to give&mdash;the Achaean league<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
by Mr. Capes, and the sumptuous Oxford edition of
extracts by Mr. Strachan-Davidson.</p>

<p>The translation is made from the text of Hultsch
and follows his arrangement of the fragments. If this
causes some inconvenience to those who use the older
texts, I hope that such inconvenience will be minimised
by the full index which I have placed at the end of
the second volume.</p>

<p>I have not, I repeat, undertaken to write a commentary.
I propose rather to give the materials for
commentary to those who, for various reasons, do not
care to use the Greek of Polybius. I have therefore in
the first five complete books left him to speak for
himself, with the minimum of notes which seemed
necessary for the understanding of his text. The case
of the fragments was different. In giving a translation
of them I have tried, when possible, to indicate the part
of the history to which they belong, and to connect
them by brief sketches of intermediate events, with full
references to those authors who supply the missing
links.</p>

<p>Imperfect as the performance of such a task must, I
fear, be, it has been one of no ordinary labour, and has
occupied every hour that could be spared during several
years of a not unlaborious life. And though I cannot
hope to have escaped errors, either of ignorance or
human infirmity, I trust that I may have produced what
will be found of use to some historical students, in giving
them a fairly faithful representation of the works of an
historian who is, in fact, our sole authority for some
most interesting portions of the world&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>It remains to give a brief account of the gradual
formation of the text of Polybius, as we now have it.</p>

<p>The revival of interest in the study of Polybius was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
due to Pope Nicholas V (1447-1455), the founder of
the Vatican Library. Soon after his election he seems
to have urged Cardinal Perotti to undertake a Latin
translation of the five books then known to exist.
When Perotti sent him his translation of the first book,
the Pope thus acknowledges it in a letter dated 28th
August 1452:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p class="tb">&#8220;<i>Primus Polybii liber, quem ad nos misisti, nuper a
te de Graeca in Latinam translatus, gratissimus etiam fuit
et jucundissimus: quippe in ea translatione nobis cumulatissime
satisfacis. Tanta enim facilitate et eloquentia
transfers, ut Historia ipsa nunquam Graeca, sed prorsus
Latina semper fuisse videatur. Optimum igitur ingenium
tuum valde commendamus atque probamus, teque hortamur
ut velis pro laude et gloria tua, et pro voluptate nimia
singulare opus inchoatum perficere, nec labori parcas.
Nam et rem ingenio et doctrina tua dignam, et nobis
omnium gratissimam efficies; qui laborum et studiorum
tuorum aliquando memores erimus.... Tu vero, si nobis
rem gratam efficere cupis, nihil negligentiae committas in
hoc opere traducendo. Nihil enim nobis gratius efficere
poteris. Librum primum a vertice ad calcem legimus, in
cujus translatione voluntati nostrae amplissime satisfactum
est.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">On the 3d of January 1454 the Pope writes again
to Perotti thanking him for the third book; and in a
letter to Torelli, dated 13th November 1453, Perotti
says that he had finished his translation of Polybius in
the preceding September. This translation was first
printed in 1473. The Greek text was not printed till
1530, when an edition of the first five books in Greek,
along with Perotti&#8217;s translation, was published at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>Hague, <i>opera Vincentii Obsopaei</i>, dedicated to George,
Marquess of Brandenburg. Perotti&#8217;s translation was
again printed at Basle in 1549, accompanied by a Latin
translation of the fragments of books 6 to 17 by
Wolfgang Musculus, and reprinted at the Hague in 1598.</p>

<p>The chief fragments of Polybius fall into two classes;
(1) those made by some unknown epitomator, who
Casaubon even supposed might be Marcus Brutus, who,
according to Plutarch, was engaged in this work in his
tent the night before the battle of Pharsalus. The
printing of these began with two insignificant fragments
on the battle between the Rhodians and Attalus against
Philip, Paris, 1536; and another <i>de re navali</i>, Basle,
1537. These fragments have continually accumulated
by fresh discoveries. (2) The other class of fragments
are those made by the order of Constantinus Porphyrogenitus
(911-959), among similar ones from other
historians, which were to be digested under fifty-three
heads or tituli; one of which (the 27th) has come down
to us, discovered in the sixteenth century, containing the
<i>selecta de legationibus</i>; and another (the 50th) <i>de virtute
et vitio</i>. The printing of the first of these begins with
the edition of Fulvius Ursinus, published at Antwerp in
1582. This was supplemented in 1634 (Paris) by an
edition by Valesius of <i>excerpta ex collectaneis Constantini
Augusti Porphyrogeneti</i>. The first edition of something
like a complete text of Polybius, containing the five
entire books, the <i>excerptae legationes</i>, and fragments of
the other books, was that of Isaac Casaubon, Paris,
1609, fo. It was accompanied by a new and very
brilliant Latin translation, and a preface which has
been famous among such works. It contains also a
Latin translation of Aeneas Tacticus. Altogether it is
a splendid book. Some additional <i>annotationes</i> of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
Casaubon&#8217;s were published after his death in 1617,
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Other editions followed; that of Gronovius,
Amsterdam, 1670: of Ernesti, Leipsic, 1764, containing
Casaubon&#8217;s translation more or less emended, and
additional fragments. But the next important step in
the bibliography of Polybius was the publication of the
great edition of Schweighaeuser, Leipsic, 1789-1795, in
nine volumes, with a new Latin translation,&mdash;founded,
however, to a great extent on Casaubon,&mdash;a new
recension of the text, and still farther additions to the
fragments; accompanied also by an excellent Lexicon
and Onomasticon. This great work has been the
foundation from which all modern commentaries on
Polybius must spring. Considerable additions to the
fragments, collected from MSS. in the Vatican by
Cardinal Mai, were published in 1827 at Rome. The
chief modern texts are those of Bekker, 1844; Duebner
(with Latin translation), 1839 and 1865; Dindorf,
1866-1868, 1882 (Teubner). A new recension of the
five books and all the known fragments&mdash;founded on a
collation of some twelve MSS. and all previous editions,
as well as all the numerous works of importance on
our Author that have appeared in Germany and elsewhere&mdash;was
published by F. Hultsch, Berlin, 1867-1872,
in four volumes. This must now be considered
the standard text. A second edition of the first volume
appeared in 1888, but after that part of my translation
had passed through the press.</p>

<p>Of English translations the earliest was by Ch.
Watson, 1568, of the first five books. It is entitled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span><i>The Hystories of the most famous Cronographer Polybios;
Discoursing of the warres betwixt the Romanes and Carthaginenses,
a rich and goodly work, conteining holsome
counsels and wonderful devices against the inconstances
of fickle Fortune. Englished by C[hristopher] W[atson]
whereunto is annexed an Abstract, compendiously coarcted
out of the life and worthy Acts perpetrate by oure puissant
Prince King Henry the fift. London, Imprinted by
Henry Byneman for Tho. Hacket, 1568</i>, 8vo. See
Herbert&#8217;s <i>Ames</i>, p. 895. Another translation of the
five books was published by Edward Grimestone,
London, 1634, of which a second and third edition
appeared in 1648 and 1673. A translation of the
Mercenary War from the first book was made by Sir
Walter Raleigh, and published after his death in 1647
(London, 4to). Next, a new translation of the five books
was published in London, 1693 (2 vols. 8vo), by Sir
H[enry] S[hears], with a preface by Dryden. In 1741
(London, 4to) appeared &#8220;A fragment of the 6th book
containing a dissertation on government, translated from
the Greek of Polybius, with notes, etc., by A Gentleman.&#8221;
This was followed by the first English translation, which
contained any part of the fragments, as well as the five
books, by the Rev. James Hampton, London, 4to, 1756-1761,
which between that date and 1823 (2 vols.,
Oxford) went through at least seven editions. Lastly,
a translation of Polybius&#8217;s account of Hannibal&#8217;s
passage of the Alps is appended by Messrs. Church
and Brodribb to their translation of Livy, 21-22.
There is a German translation by A. Haakh and Kraz,
Stuttgart, 1858-1875. And a French translation by
J. A. C. Buchon, Paris, 1842, Orl&eacute;ans, 1875. For the
numerous German essays and dissertations on the text,
and particular questions arising from the history, I must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
refer my readers to Engelmann&#8217;s <i>Bibliotheca</i>. In England
such studies are rare. Mr. Strachan-Davidson published
an essay on Polybius in Hellenica; and his edition of
extracts of the text (Oxford, 1888) contains several
dissertations of value. Mr. Capes (London, 1888) has
published an edition of extracts referring to the Achaean
league, with an introductory essay on the author and
his work. And a very admirable article on Polybius
appears in the recent edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i> by Mr. H. F. Pelham. There is also a good
paper on Polybius in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for 1879,
No. 296. Criticisms on Polybius, and estimates of his
value as an historian, will be found in Thirlwall&#8217;s
<i>History of Greece</i>, vol. viii.; Arnold&#8217;s <i>History of Rome</i>;
Mommsen&#8217;s <i>History of Rome</i>, book iv. c. xiii.; Freeman&#8217;s
<i>History of Federal Government</i> and <i>Essays</i>; Bunbury&#8217;s
<i>Ancient Geography</i>, vol. ii. p. 16; Law&#8217;s <i>Alps of
Hannibal</i>. For the Roman side of his history, besides
the works mentioned by Mr. Strachan-Davidson, a good
list of the literature on the 2d Punic war is given by
Mr. W. T. Arnold in his edition of Dr. Arnold&#8217;s history
of that period [London, Macmillan, 1886].</p>

<p>Finally, I have to express my warm thanks to Dr.
Warre, Head Master of Eton, for aiding me with his
unique knowledge of ancient and modern tactics in
clearing up many points very puzzling to a civilian.
To Mr. W. Chawner, Fellow and Tutor of Emmanuel
College, for reading part of the translation in proof, and
making valuable corrections and suggestions. And to
Professor Ridgway, of Queen&#8217;s College, Cork, for corrections
in the geographical fragments of book 34.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>I. POLYBIUS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Fortune</span> cast the life of Polybius in stirring times. His
special claim to our admiration is that he understood the
importance in the history of the world of the changes which
were passing under his eyes, and exerted himself to trace the
events which immediately preceded them, and from which
they sprang, while it was yet possible to see and question
surviving participators in them; to examine places, before
they had lost all marks of the great events of which they had
been the scene; and records or monuments before time had
cast a doubt upon their meaning or authenticity. Nor is this
ordinary praise. Men are apt to turn their eyes upon the
past, as holding all that is worthy of contemplation, while
they fail to take note of history &#8220;in the making,&#8221; or to grasp
the importance of the transactions of their own day. But as
every year has its decisive influence on the years which
succeed it, the greatest benefactor of posterity is the man who
understands and records events as they pass with care and
sincerity. Laborious compilation, from the study and comparison
of ancient records and monuments, has its value: it
may often be all that it is possible to obtain; it may not unfrequently
even serve to correct statements of contemporaries
which have been deformed by carelessness or coloured by
prejudice. But the best compilation is infinitely inferior in
interest and instructiveness to the barest report of a contemporary.
And when such a man is also an eye-witness of
much that he relates; when he knew and conversed with
many of the chief actors in the great events which he records;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
when again he tells us of transactions so remote in time, that
all written documents have necessarily perished, and those in
more durable bronze and stone all but followed in their train,
then indeed the interest rises to the highest pitch. Like
Herodotus and Thucydides, then, Polybius tells us of his own
times, and of the generations immediately preceding them.
It is true that the part of his work which has survived in a
complete form deals with a period before his own day, just as
the greater part of the history of Herodotus does, but in the
larger part of the fragments he is writing with even more complete
personal knowledge than Thucydides. He had, again,
neither the faculty for story-telling possessed by Herodotus
nor the literary and dramatic force of Thucydides. The
language which he spoke and wrote had lost the magic of style;
had lost the lucidity and grace of Sophocles, and the rugged
vigour and terseness of Thucydides. Nor had he apparently
acquired any of those artifices which, while they sometimes
weary us in the later rhetoricians, yet generally serve to make
their writings the easiest and pleasantest of reading. Equally
remote again is his style from the elaborate and involved
manner of Plutarch, with its huge compound words built up
of intricate sentences, more like difficult German than Greek.
Polybius had no tricks of this sort;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> but his style lacks
logical order and clearness. It seems rather the language of
a man of affairs, who had had neither leisure to study style,
nor taste to read widely with a view to literature as such.
But after all it is Greek, and Greek that still retained its
marvellous adaptability to every purpose, to every shade of
thought, and every form of literature. Nor is his style in the
purely narrative parts of his work wanting in a certain force,
derived from singleness and directness of purpose. He
&#8220;speaks right on,&#8221; and turns neither to the right hand nor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>the left. It is when he reflects and argues and moralises, that
his want of literary skill sometimes makes him difficult and
involved; and though the thought is essentially just, and his
point of view wonderfully modern, we continually feel the want
of that nameless charm which the Greeks called &#967;&#8049;&#961;&#953;&#962;.</p>

<p>His bent for historical composition was fortunately
encouraged by the circumstances of his life, which gave
Polybius special opportunities of satisfying his curiosity and
completing his knowledge. Not only was he the son of a man
who had held the highest office in the league, and so must have
heard the politics and history of Achaia discussed from his earliest
youth; not only from early manhood was he himself in the thick
of political business; but he knew the sovereigns of Egypt and
Pergamus, of Macedonia and Syria, and the Roman generals
who conquered the latter. He had visited a Roman camp and
witnessed its practical arrangements and discipline. And his
enforced residence of sixteen years in Italy and Rome was, by
the good fortune of his introduction to Aemilius Paullus and
his sons, turned into an opportunity of unrivalled advantage
for studying the laws, military discipline, and character of the
imperial people whose world conquest he chronicles. Unlike
his fellow-exiles, he did not allow his depressing circumstances
to numb his faculties, exasperate his temper, or deaden his
curiosity. He won the confidence of the leading men at
Rome; and seems, while pushing on his inquiries with untiring
vigour, to have used his influence for the benefit of his
countrymen, and of all Greek subjects of Rome.</p>

<p>But, like so many of the writers of antiquity, he has had
no one to perform for him the service he had done for others
in rescuing their achievements and the particulars of their
career from oblivion. Of the many <i>testimonia</i> collected by
Schweighaeuser and others from ancient writers, scarcely one
gives us any details or anecdotes of the writer, whose work
they briefly describe or praise. We are reduced as usual to
pick out from his own writings the scattered allusions or
statements which help us to picture his character and career.</p>

<p>Polybius of Megalopolis was the son of Lycortas, the friend
and partisan of Philopoemen, who had served the Achaean
league in several capacities: as ambassador to Rome in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;189,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Birth of Polybius.</span>
along with Diophanes, on the question of the war with
Sparta,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and to Ptolemy Epiphanes in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;186,
<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and finally as Strategus in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;184-183.
Of the year of his birth we cannot be certain.
He tells us that he was elected to go on embassy from the
league to Ptolemy Epiphanes in the year of the death of that
monarch (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;181), although he was below the legal age.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
But we do not know for certain what that age was; although
it seems likely that it was thirty, that apparently being the age
at which a member of the league exercised his full privileges.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
But assuming this, we do not know how much under that age
he was. Two years previously (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;183) he had carried the
urn at Philopoemen&#8217;s funeral. This was an office usually performed
by quite young men (&#957;&#949;&#945;&#957;&#8055;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#953;)<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, probably not much
over twenty years old. As we know that he lived to write a history
of the Numantine war, which ended <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;133<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>, and that he
was eighty-two at the time of his death<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>, we shall not, I think,
be probably far wrong if we place his birth in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;203 and
his death in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;121 as Casaubon does, who notes that the
latter is just sixteen years before the birth of Cicero. But
though this is a good working hypothesis, it is very far from
being a demonstrated fact.</p>

<p>Between <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;181-168 he was closely allied with his father
in politics; and if we wish to have any conception of what he
was doing, it is necessary to form some idea of the state of
parties in the Peloponnese at the time.</p>

<p>The crowning achievement of Philopoemen&#8217;s career had
been the uniting of Sparta to the Achaean league, after the
murder of the tyrant Nabis by the Aetolians who had come to
Sparta as his allies (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;192). In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;191 the Achaeans
were allowed to add Messene and Elis to their league, as a
reward for their services to Rome in the war against Antiochus.
The Aetolian league, the chief enemy and opponent of
Achaia, was reduced to a state of humble dependence on
Rome in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;189, after the defeat of Antiochus at Thermopylae
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;191) and the Aetolian war (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;191-189). From <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>190 then begins the time during which Polybius says that the
&#8220;name of the Achaeans became the universal one for all the
inhabitants of the Peloponnese&#8221; (<b>2</b>, <a href="#b2_42">42</a>). But though Sparta
was included in the league she was always a restive and dissatisfied
member; and the people of Elis and Messene, who
were not very willing members either, were told by Flamininus
that if they had any reason to complain of the federal government
they were to appeal to him.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Now, by a treaty of
alliance with Rome, decreed at Sikyon in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;198, it was
provided that Rome should receive no envoys from separate
states of the league, but only from the league itself.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Flamininus,
therefore, if he said what Livy reports him to have said,
was violating this treaty. And this will be a good instance to
illustrate the divisions of parties existing during the period of
Polybius&#8217;s active political life (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;181-169). We have seen
that in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;198 the Achaean league became an ally of Rome
as a complete and independent state; that this state was
consolidated by the addition of Sparta (192) and Elis and
Messene (191) so as to embrace the whole of the Peloponnese;
that its chief enemy in Greece, the Aetolian league,
was rendered powerless in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;189. The Macedonian influence
in the Peloponnese had been abolished after the battle
of Cynoscephalae (197) by the proclamation of Greek freedom
by Flamininus (196). But all this seeming liberty and growth
in power really depended upon the favour of Rome, and was
continually endangered not only by the appeals to the Senate
from separate states in the league, who conceived themselves
wronged, but by treasonable representations of her own envoys,
who preferred a party triumph to the welfare and independence
of their country<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>. In these circumstances, there were
naturally differences of opinion as to the proper attitude for
the league government to assume towards a state, which was
nominally an equal ally, but really an absolute master.
There was one party who were for submissively carrying
out the will of the Roman officers who from time to
time visited the Peloponnese; and for conciliating the
Senate by displaying a perpetual readiness to carry out its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>wishes, without putting forward in any way the rights which
the treaty of 198 had secured to them. The leaders of this
party, in the time of Philopoemen, were Aristaenos and
Diophanes. The other party, headed till his death by
Philopoemen, equally admitting that the Roman government
could not be safely defied, were yet for aiming at preserving
their country&#8217;s independence by strictly carrying out the terms
of the Roman alliance, and respectfully but firmly resisting
any encroachment upon those terms by the officers representing
the Roman government. On Philopoemen&#8217;s death (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
183) Lycortas, who had been his most devoted follower, took,
along with Archon, the lead of the party which were for carrying
out his policy; while Callicrates became the most prominent
of the Romanising party. Lycortas was supported by his son
Polybius when about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;181 he began to take part in politics.
Polybius seems always to have consistently maintained this
policy. His view seems to have been that Rome, having crushed
Philip and Antiochus, was necessarily the supreme power. The
Greeks must recognise facts; must avoid offending Rome; but
must do so by keeping to a position of strict legality, maintaining
their rights, and neither flattering nor defying the victorious
Commonwealth. He believed that the Romans meant fairly
by Greece, and that Greek freedom was safe in their hands<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.
But the straightforward policy of the Senate, if it was ever
sincere, was altered by the traitor Callicrates in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;179;
who, being sent to Rome to oppose what the league thought
the unconstitutional restitution of certain Spartan exiles, advised
the Senate to use the Romanising party in each state to
secure a direct control in Achaia<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>. Acting on this insidious
advice, the Roman government began to view with suspicion
the legal and independent attitude of the other party, and to
believe or affect to believe that they were enemies of the
Roman supremacy. Lycortas, Archon, and Polybius, finding
themselves the objects of suspicion, not less dangerous because
undeserved, to the Roman government, appear to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>adopted an attitude of reserve, abstaining from taking an
active or prominent part in the business of the assemblies.
This, however, did not succeed in averting Roman jealousy;
and the commissioners, Gaius Popilius and Gnaeus Octavius,
who visited the Peloponnese in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;169, gave out that those
who held aloof were as displeasing to the Senate as those who
openly opposed it. They were said to have resolved on
formally impeaching the three statesmen before the Achaean
assembly as being enemies of Rome; but when the assembly
met at Aegium, they had failed to obtain any reasonable
handle against them, and contented themselves with a speech
of general exhortation.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> This was during the war with Perseus,
when the Romans kept a vigilant eye on all parts of
Greece, and closely inquired which politicians in the several
states ventured to display the least sympathy with the
Macedonian king, or were believed to secretly nourish any wish
for his success. It speaks strongly both for the independent
spirit still surviving in the league, as well as for the character
of Archon and Polybius, that they were elected, apparently
in the same assembly, the one Strategus and the other
Hipparch for the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;169-168.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> In this office Polybius
doubtless hoped to carry out the principles and discipline of
Philopoemen, under whom he had probably served in the
cavalry, and whose management of this branch of the service
he had at any rate minutely studied.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> But there was little
occasion for the use of the Achaean cavalry in his year.
Being sent on a mission to Q. Marcius Philippus at Heracleia
to offer the league&#8217;s assistance in the war with Perseus, when
their help was declined, he remained behind after the other
ambassadors had returned, to witness the campaign.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> After
spending some time in the Roman camp, he was sent by
Q. Marcius to prevent the Achaeans from consenting to supply
five thousand men to Appius Claudius Cento in Epirus. This
was a matter of considerable delicacy. He had to choose
between offending one or the other powerful Roman. But he
conducted the affair with prudence, and on the lines he had
always laid down, those, namely, of strict legality. He found
the Achaean assembly in session at Sicyon; and he carried
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>his point by representing that the demand of Appius Claudius
did not bear on the face of it the order of the Senate, without
which they were prohibited from supplying the requisitions of
Roman commanders.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> He thus did not betray that he was
acting on the instigation of Quintus Marcius, and put himself
and the league in an attitude of loyalty toward the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
In the same cautious spirit he avoided another complication.
Certain complimentary statues or inscriptions had been put
up in various cities of the league in honour of Eumenes, king
of Pergamus, and on some offence arising had been taken
down. This seems to have annoyed Eumenes exceedingly;
and Polybius persuaded the people that it had been ordered
by Sosigenes and Diopeithes, as judges, from feelings of
personal spite, and without any act of Eumenes unfriendly to
the league. He carried his point, and thus avoided offending
a king who at that time was on very friendly terms with
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> But while thus minded to avoid unnecessary offence,
Polybius and his party were in favour of strengthening the
league by alliances which could be entered upon with safety.
Egypt at this time was under the joint government of two
Ptolemies, Philometor and Physcon, who were being threatened
with an invasion by Antiochus Epiphanes. The friendship
of the league with the kings of Egypt had been of long
standing, as far back as the time of Aratus; and though that
friendship had been afterwards interrupted by the Macedonian
policy of Aratus, just before his death the father of these kings
had presented the league with ten ships and a sum of money.
The two kings now sent to beg for aid; and asked that
Lycortas should come as commander-in-chief, and Polybius as
hipparch. Lycortas and Polybius were in favour of supplying
the assistance asked.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> But the measure was opposed by
Callicrates and his partisans, on the specious ground that their
whole efforts should be directed to aid the Romans against
Perseus. Lycortas and Polybius replied that the Romans did
not require their help; and that they were bound, by gratitude,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>as well as by treaty, to help the Ptolemies. They carried with
them the popular feeling: but Callicrates outwitted them by
obtaining a dispatch from Q. Marcius, urging the league to
join the senate in effecting a reconciliation between Antiochus
and the kings of Egypt. Polybius gave in, and advised compliance.
Ambassadors were appointed to aid in the pacification;
and the envoys from Alexandria were obliged to depart
without effecting their object. They contented themselves
with handing in to the magistrates the Royal letters, in which
Lycortas and Polybius were invited by name to come to
Alexandria.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Careful, however, as he had ever been to avoid giving just
offence to Rome, he and his party had long <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;167.</span>
been marked by the Senate as opponents of
that more complete interference in the details of Achaean
politics which it wished to exercise. This was partly owing to
the machinations of Callicrates; but it was also the result of
the deliberate policy of the Senate: and it was doubtless helped
by the report of every Roman officer who had found himself
thwarted by the appeal to legality, under the influence of the
party in the league with which Polybius was connected.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
Accordingly, soon after the final defeat of Perseus by Aemilius
Paulus in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;168, and the consequent dismemberment of
Macedonia, the Senate proceeded to execute its vengeance
upon those citizens in every state in Greece who were believed
to have been opposed to the Roman interests. The commissioners
entrusted with the settlement and division of Macedonia
were directed to hold an inquiry into this matter also. From
every city the extreme partisans of Rome were summoned to
assist them, men who were only too ready to sacrifice their
political opponents to the vengeance of the power to which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>they had long been paying a servile and treacherous court.
From Boeotia came Mnasippus; from Acarnania, Chremes;
from Epirus, Charops and Nicias; from Aetolia, Lyciscus and
Tisippus; and from Achaia, Callicrates, Agesias, and Philippus.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
Instigated by these advisers, the commissioners ordered the
supposed covert enemies of Rome in the several states to
proceed to Italy to take their trial. To Achaia two commissioners,
Gaius Claudius and Gnaeus Domitius, were sent.
An Achaean assembly being summoned to meet them, they
announced that there were certain men of influence in the
league who had helped Perseus by money and other support.
They required that a vote should be passed condemning them
all to death; and said that, when that was done, they would
publish the names. Such a monstrous perversion of justice
was too much for the assembly, who refused to vote until they
knew the names. The commissioners then said that all the
Strategi who had been in office since the beginning of the war
were involved. One of them, Xeno, came forward, declared
his innocence, and asserted that he was ready to plead his
cause before any tribunal, Achaean or Roman. Upon this the
commissioners required that all the accused persons should
go to Rome. A list of one thousand names was drawn up, under
the guidance of Callicrates, of those who were at once to proceed
to Italy<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;167). The court of inquiry, before which they
were to appear, was never held. They were not allowed even
to stay in Rome, but were quartered in various cities of Italy,
which were made responsible for their safe custody: and there
they remained until <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;151, when such of them as were still
alive, numbering then somewhat less than three hundred, were
contemptuously allowed to return.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Among these detenus was
Polybius. We do not hear that Lycortas was also one, from
which it has been with some probability supposed that he was
dead. More fortunate than the rest, Polybius was allowed to
remain at Rome. He had made, it seems, the acquaintance of
Aemilius Paulus and his two sons in Macedonia, and during
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>the tour of Aemelius through Greece after the Macedonian war.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
And on their return to Italy he was allowed by their influence to
remain in Rome; and, acting as tutor to the two boys,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> became
well acquainted with all the best society in the city. The
charming account which he gives<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> of the mutual affection
existing between him and the younger son of Aemilius (by
adoption now called Publius Scipio Africanus Aemilianus)
bears all the marks of sincerity, and is highly to the credit
of both. To it we may add the anecdote of Plutarch, that
&#8220;Scipio, in observance of the precept of Polybius, endeavoured
never to leave the forum without having made a close friend of
some one he met there.&#8221;</p>

<p>But much as he owed to the friendship of the sons of
Aemilius, he owed it also to his own energy and cheerful
vigour that these sixteen years of exile were not lost time in his
life. He employed them, not in fruitless indulgence in homesickness,
or in gloomy brooding over his wrongs, but in a careful
and industrious study of the history and institutions of the
people among whom he was compelled to reside<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>; in ingratiating
himself with those members of the Senate who he thought
might be useful to his countrymen; and in forming and
maturing his judgment as to the course of policy they ought to
pursue. Nor was he without means of gratifying lighter tastes.
He was an active sportsman: and the boar-hunting in the district
of Laurentum not only diverted his attention from the
distressing circumstances of his exile, and kept his body in
vigorous health, but obtained for him the acquaintance of many
men of rank and influence. Thus for instance his intimacy
with the Syrian prince Demetrius, afterwards king Demetrius
Soter, was made in the hunting-field<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>: and the value which
this young man attached to his advice and support is some
measure of the opinion entertained generally of his wisdom,
moderation, and good judgment. We have no further details
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>of his life in Rome; but we have what is better,&mdash;its fruits,
in the luminous account of its polity, the constitution of its
army, and the aims of its statesmen.</p>

<p>At last the time came when he was once more free to visit
his own country, or to extend his knowledge by <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;151.
Release of the
detenus.</span>
visiting the countries which he wished to
describe. After repeated applications to the
Senate by embassies from Achaia, made without avail, in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
151 Polybius appeared in person to plead the cause before the
Fathers. There was now, it was thought, no reason for retaining
these unfortunate men. The original thousand had shrunk
to less than three hundred; middle-aged men had become in
sixteen years old and decrepit; they had lost connexions and
influence in the Peloponnese; they had learnt by bitter experience
the impossibility of resisting the power of Rome, and
were no longer likely to venture on organising any opposition.
Their longer detention could only be a measure of vengeance,
and useless vengeance. Still the debate in the Senate was long
and doubtful, until it was brought to a conclusion by the contemptuous
exclamation of Cato: &#8220;Are we to sit here all day
discussing whether some old Greek dotards are to be buried
by Italian or Achaean undertakers?&#8221; Polybius, elated by a
concession thus ungraciously accorded, wished to enter the
Senate once more with a further request for a restitution of
their property in Achaia. But Cato bluntly bade him &#8220;remember
Ulysses, who wanted to go back into the cave of the Cyclops
to fetch his cap and belt.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Polybius seems to have returned to the Peloponnese at
once, and to have remained there until <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;149, <span class="sidenote">Coss. L. Marcius
Censornius,
Manius Manilius,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;149.
Polybius sent
for to
Lilybaeum.</span>
when he was suddenly summoned to serve the
government whose enforced guest he had been
so long. It was the year in which the Senate
had determined to commence their proceedings
against Carthage, which were not to be stayed
until she was levelled with the ground. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;150 the
victory of Massanissa had restored the oligarchs, who had been
superseded by the popular anti-Roman party in Carthage. These
men hastened to make every possible offer of submission to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>Rome. The Senate had made up its mind for war; and yet did
not at once say so. After demanding that full satisfaction should
be made to Massanissa, it next decreed that the Carthaginians
must at once give three hundred of their noblest youths as
hostages to the Roman consuls Manilius and Censorinus, who
had sailed to Lilybaeum with secret orders to let no concession
induce them to stop the war until Carthage was destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
There was naturally some hesitation in obeying this demand
at Carthage; for the hostages were to be given to the Romans
absolutely without any terms, and without any security. They
felt that it was practically a surrender of their city. To overcome
this hesitation Manilius sent for Polybius, perhaps
because he had known and respected him at Rome, and believed
that he could trust him; perhaps because his well-known
opinion, as to the safety in trusting the Roman <i>fides</i>, might
make him a useful agent. But also probably because he was
known to many influential Carthaginians, and perhaps spoke
their language.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> He started for Lilybaeum at once. But
when he reached Corcyra he was met with the news that the
hostages had been given up to the consul: he thought, therefore,
that the chance of war was at an end, and he returned to
the Peloponnese.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>He must soon have learnt his mistake. The Consul, in
accordance with his secret instructions,&mdash;first to secure the
arms in Carthage, and then to insist on the destruction of the
town,&mdash;gradually let the wretched people know the extent of
the submission required of them. These outrageous demands
resulted in the Carthaginians taking the desperate resolution
of standing a siege. Censorinus and his colleague accordingly
began operations; but they were not capable of so great an
undertaking. The eyes of the whole army were turned upon
Scipio Aemilianus, who was serving as a military tribune. The
siege lingered through the summer of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;148 without any
result; and when in the autumn Scipio left for Rome, to stand
for the Aedileship, he started amidst loud expressions of hope
that he might return as Consul, though below the legal age.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span></p>

<p>The loss of so much of Polybius&#8217;s narrative at this point leaves
us uncertain when he arrived in Africa: but as he met and conversed
with Massanissa,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> who died in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;148, it seems likely
that he did join the army after all in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;149. At any rate
he was in Scipio&#8217;s train in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;147-146, when he was in chief
command of the army, first as consul, and then as proconsul;
advised him on sundry points in the formation of
his siege works; stood by his side when Carthage was burning;
and heard him, as he watched the dreadful sight, utter
with tearful eyes the foreboding of what might one day befall
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Scipio is also said to have supplied him with ships
for an exploring expedition round the coast of Africa;<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and
it seems most likely that this was in his year of consulship
(147), as after the fall of Carthage Polybius went home.</p>

<p>The destruction of Carthage took place in the spring of
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146. When Scipio went back to celebrate his triumph,
Polybius seems to have returned to the Peloponnese, there to
witness another act of vengeance on the part of Rome, and to
do what he could to lighten the blow to his countrymen, and
to preserve the fragments of their shattered liberties.</p>

<p>Among the restored Achaean exiles were Diaeus, Damocritus,
Alcamenes, Theodectes, and Archicrates. They had
returned with feelings embittered by their exile; and without
any of the experience of active life, which might have taught
them to subordinate their private thirst for revenge to the
safety of their country. Callicrates died in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;148, and Diaeus
was Strategus in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;149-148, 147-146. The appearance of
the pseudo-Philip (Andriscus) in Macedonia, and the continued
resistance of Carthage during his first year of office (148), encouraged
him perhaps to venture on a course, and to recommend
the people to adopt a policy, on which he would otherwise
not have ventured. Troubles arising out of a disgraceful
money transaction between the Spartan Menalchidas, Achaean
Strategus, and the Oropians, who had bribed him to aid them
against the Athenians, had led to a violent quarrel with Callicrates,
who threatened to impeach him for treason to the league
in the course of an embassy to Rome. To save himself he gave
half the Oropian money to Diaeus, his successor as Strategus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span>
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;149-148). This led to a popular clamour against Diaeus:
who, to save himself, falsely reported that the Senate had
granted the Achaeans leave to try and condemn certain Spartans
for the offence of occupying a disputed territory. Sparta was
prepared to resist in arms, and a war seemed to be on the
point of breaking out. Callicrates and Diaeus, however, were
sent early in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;148 to place the Achaean case before the
Senate, while the Spartans sent Menalchidas. Callicrates
died on the road. The Senate heard, therefore, the two sides
from Diaeus and Menalchidas, and answered that they would
send commissioners to inquire into the case. The commissioners,
however, were slow in coming; so that both Diaeus
and Menalchidas had time to misrepresent the Senate&#8217;s answer
to their respective peoples. The Achaeans believed that they
had full leave to proceed according to the league law against
the Spartans; the Spartans believed that they had permission
to break off from the league. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;148.</span>
Once more,
therefore, war was on the point of breaking
out.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Just at this time Q. Caecilius Metellus was in Macedonia
with an army to crush Andriscus. He was sending
some commissioners to Asia, and ordered them to visit the
Peloponnese on their way and give a friendly warning. It
was neglected, and the Spartans sustained a defeat, which
irritated them without crushing their revolt. When Diaeus
succeeded Damocritus as Strategus in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;147, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;147.</span>
he answered a second embassy from Metellus
by a promise not to take any hostile steps until the Roman
commissioners arrived. But he irritated the Spartans by
putting garrisons into some forts which commanded Laconia;
and they actually elected Menalchidas as a Strategus in
opposition to Diaeus. But finding that he had no chance of
success Menalchidas poisoned himself.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>Then followed the riot at Corinth.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Marcus Aurelius
Orestes at the head of a commission arrived at last at Corinth,
and there informed the magistrates in council that the league
must give up Argos, Corinth, and Sparta. The magistrates
hastily summoned an assembly and announced the message
from the Senate; a furious riot followed, every man in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</a></span>
Corinth suspected of being a Spartan was seized and thrown
into prison; the very residence of the Roman commissioners
was not able to afford such persons any protection, and even
the persons of Orestes and his colleagues were in imminent
danger.</p>

<p>Some months afterwards a second commission arrived
headed by Sextus Julius Caesar, and demanded, without any
express menace, that the authors of the riot should be given up.
The demand was evaded; and when Caesar returned to Rome
with his report, war was at once declared.</p>

<p>The new Strategus, elected in the autumn of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;147, was
Critolaus. He was a bitter anti-Romanist like
Diaeus: <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;147-146.</span>
and these statesmen and their party
fancied that the Romans, having already two wars on hand, at
Carthage and in Spain, would make any sacrifice to keep peace
with Achaia. They had not indeed openly declined the demands
of Sextus, but, to use Polybius&#8217;s expressive phrase, &#8220;they
accepted with the left hand what the Romans offered with the
right.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> While pretending to be preparing to submit their case
to the Senate, they were collecting an army from the cities of
the league. Inspired with an inexplicable infatuation, which
does not deserve the name of courage, Critolaus even advanced
northwards towards Thermopylae, as if he could with his petty
force bar the road to the Romans and free Greece. He was
encouraged, it was said, by a party at Thebes which had suffered
from Rome for its Macedonising policy. But, rash as the
march was, it was managed with at least equal imprudence.
Instead of occupying Thermopylae, they stopped short of it to
besiege Trachinian Heracleia, an old Spartan colony,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> which
refused to join the league. While engaged in this, Critolaus
heard that Metellus (who wished to anticipate his successor
Mummius) was on the march from Macedonia. He beat a
hasty retreat to Scarpheia in Locris,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> which was on the road
leading to Elateia and the south; here he was overtaken and
defeated with considerable slaughter. Critolaus appears not to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span>have fallen on the field; but he was never seen again. He was
either lost in some marshes over which he attempted to escape,
as Pausanias suggests, or poisoned himself, as Livy says.
Diaeus, as his predecessor, became Strategus, and was elected
for the following year also. Diaeus exerted himself to collect
troops for the defence of Corinth, nominally as being at
war with Sparta. He succeeded in getting as many as
fourteen thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry, consisting
partly of citizens and partly of slaves; and sent
four thousand picked men under Alcamenes to hold
Megara, while he himself occupied Corinth. When Metellus
approached, however, this outpost at Megara hastily retreated
into Corinth. Metellus took up his position in the Isthmus,
and offered the Achaeans the fairest terms. Diaeus, however,
induced them to reject all offers; and Metellus was kept some
time encamped before Corinth.</p>

<p>It was now late in the spring of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146, and the new
Consul, Lucius Mummius, arrived at the Roman
camp. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146.
Arrival of
Mummius.</span>
He at once sent Metellus back to
Macedonia, and quietly awaited the arrival of
fresh troops, which he had sent for from Crete and Pergamum,
as well as from Italy.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> He eventually had an army of about
thirty thousand men, nearly double of the Greek army in
Corinth. Nothing apparently was done till the late summer, or
autumn. But then the final catastrophe was rapid and complete.
The Roman officers regarded the Achaean force with such
contempt, that they did not take proper precautions, so that
Diaeus won a slight advantage against one of the Roman
outposts. Flushed with this success, he drew out for a pitched
battle, in which he was totally defeated. He made his way to
Megalopolis, where, after killing his wife, he poisoned himself.</p>

<p>Thus by a series of imprudent measures, which Polybius
denounces, but was not at home to oppose, the Achaean league
had drifted into downright war with Rome; and, almost without
a struggle, had fallen helplessly at her feet, forced to accept
whatever her mercy or contempt might grant. Mercy, however,
was to be preceded by stern punishment. Corinth was given
up to plunder and to fire, and Polybius returned from Africa in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</a></span>
time to witness it.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The destruction or deportation of works of
art, of pictures, statues, and costly furniture, he
could not prevent; <span class="sidenote">Polybius saves
some statues of
national interest.</span>
but he spoke a successful
word to preserve the statues of Philopoemen
in the various cities from destruction; and also begged successfully
for the restoration of some of the Eponymous hero
Achaeus, and of Philopoemen and Aratus, which had already
been transported as far as Acarnania on their way to Italy.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
He also dissuaded his friends from rushing to take their share
in the plunder by purchasing the confiscated goods of Diaeus,
which were put to auction and could be bought at low rates;
and he refused to accept any of them himself.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>The settlement of the territories of the league was put into
the hands of a commission of ten men who
were sent out after the sack of Corinth; <span class="sidenote">The new settlement
of the Peloponnese,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146-145.</span>
while
Mummius, after seeing that such towns in the
Peloponnese as had joined in the war were
deprived of their fortifications and arms, and after inflicting
punishment upon other towns in Greece which had shown
active sympathy with Perseus, especially Thebes and Chalcis,
returned home to celebrate his triumph, which was adorned
with marble and bronze statues and pictures from Corinth.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
The commissioners who had been sent out to make a final settlement
of Greece, or Achaia, as it was henceforth to be called in
official language, settled the general plan in conjunction with
Mummius; but the commissioners continued their labours
for six months, at the end of which time they departed, leaving
Polybius to settle with each town the details of their local
legislation. The general principles which the commissioners
laid down were first, the entire abolition of all the leagues, and
consequently of the league assemblies; each town, with its
surrounding district, which had once formed a canton in the
league, was to be separate and independent: its magistrates,
secondly, were to be selected according to a fixed assessment
of property, the old equality or democracy being abolished:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</a>
</span>thirdly, no member of one canton might own property in
another: fourthly, the Boeotians were ordered to pay a heavy
compensation to the Heracleots and Euboeans, and the
Achaeans to the Spartans: lastly, a fixed tribute to Rome
was imposed on all states in Greece.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Some of these measures
were in a few years&#8217; time relaxed, the fines were mitigated,
the rule against inter-possession of property was abolished, and
the league assemblies were again allowed for certain local
purposes. But this was the end of the league as a free
federation. It is often said that &#8220;Greece was now reduced
to the form of a Roman province under the name of Achaia.&#8221;
This is true in a sense, and yet is misleading. Achaia did
not become a province like the other provinces, yearly allotted
to a proconsul or propraetor or legatus, until the time of
Augustus. Such direct interference from a Roman magistrate
as was thought necessary was left to the governor of Macedonia.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
Yet in a certain sense Achaia was treated as a
separate entity, and had a &#8220;formula,&#8221; or constitution, founded
on the separate local laws which the commissioners found
existing, or imposed, with the help of Polybius, on the several
states; it paid tribute like other provinces, and was in fact,
though called free, subject to Rome.</p>

<p>Polybius performed his task of visiting the various towns
in the Peloponnese, explaining when necessary the meaning of
the new arrangements, and advising them, when they had to
make others for themselves, so much to the satisfaction of
every one, that there was a universal feeling that he had been
a benefactor to his country, and had made the best of their
situation that could be made. Statues of him are mentioned
by Pausanias in several places in the Peloponnese: in Mantinea<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
and at Megalopolis,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> with an inscription in elegiacs to the
effect that &#8220;he had travelled over every land and sea; was an
ally of the Romans, and mitigated their wrath against Greece.&#8221;
Another in the temple of Persephone, near Acacesium,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</a></span>which was a legend stating that &#8220;Greece would not have erred
at all if she had obeyed Polybius; and that when she did err,
he alone proved of any help to her.&#8221; There were others also
at Pallantium,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Tegea,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> and Olympia.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>In these services to his country Polybius was occupied in
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;145. Of his life after that we have no detailed record.
He is believed to have visited Scipio while engaged on the
siege of Numantia (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;134-132), on which he wrote a separate
treatise.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> We know also that he visited Alexandria in the
reign of Ptolemy Physcon (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146-117), and expressed
his contempt for the state of the people and their rulers.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
These years must have been also much occupied with the
extension of his history, which he originally intended should
end with the fall of the Macedonian kingdom (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;168),<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> but
which was afterwards continued to the fall of Carthage and
Greece (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146);<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> for even if the history had been completed
up to its originally intended limit, and the notice of extension
afterwards inserted, there still was enough to do to occupy
some years of a busy life; especially as he seems to have
carried out his principle that an historian ought to be a
traveller, visiting the localities of which he speaks, and testing
by personal inspection the possibility of the military evolutions
which he undertakes to describe. His travels appear certainly
to have embraced the greater part of Gaul, and it even seems
possible from one passage that he visited Britain.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> His explorations
on the African coast were doubtless extensive, and
he appears to have visited Phoenicia, Cilicia, and Asia Minor.
We hear of him at Sardis, though we cannot fix the date of
the visit.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Lastly, Lucian tells us that, &#8220;returning from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</a></span>
country, he had a fall from his horse, from the effects of which
he died at the age of eighty-two.&#8221; No place is given, and no
clue which may help us to be certain of the date.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> Polybius,
besides the general history, had written a treatise on Tactics,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
a panegyric on Philopoemen,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> a history of the Numantine
war,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> and perhaps a treatise on public speaking (&#948;&#951;&#956;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#8055;&#945;).<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<h3>&sect; 2.&mdash;THE SOURCES OF POLYBIUS&#8217;S HISTORY</h3>

<p>Polybius always maintains that the study of documents is
only one, and not the most important, element in the equipment
of an historian. The best is personal experience and
personal inquiry.</p>

<p>Of the sources of his own history, then, the first and best
<span class="sidenote">Personal
knowledge.</span>
may be set down as knowledge acquired by
being actually present at great events, such as the
destruction of Carthage and the sack of Corinth;
visits to the Roman army in camp; assisting at actual debates
in his own country; personal knowledge of and service under
men of the first position in Achaia; personal visits to famous
localities; voyages and tours undertaken for the definite object
of inspection and inquiry; and, lastly, seeing and questioning
the survivors of great battles, or the men who had played a
leading part in conspicuous political transactions.</p>

<p>From his earliest youth Polybius had enjoyed some special
advantages in these respects. As he himself says, &#8220;the events
in Greece fell within his own generation, or that immediately
preceding his own,&mdash;and he therefore could relate what he
had seen, or what he had heard from eye-witnesses&#8221; (<b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_2">2</a>).
And of the later period he &#8220;was not only an eye-witness, but
in some cases an actor, and in others the chief actor&#8221; (<b>3</b>, <a href="#b3_4">4</a>).
When he was probably under twenty we hear of his being present
at an important interview between Philopoemen and Archon;<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
and his election as hipparch in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;169, soon after he reached
the legal age, was in consequence of his having thrown himself
with vigour into the practical working of the cavalry under
Philopoemen. In regard to Roman history and polity, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</a></span>have Cicero&#8217;s testimony that he was <i>bonus auctor in primis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> and
more particularly in regard to chronology, <i>quo nemo fuit in
exquirendis temporibus diligentius</i>.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Nor is this praise undeserved,
as is shown by his energy in pushing minute and
personal inquiries. Thus he learnt the details of the Hannibalic
war from some of the survivors of those actually engaged;
visited the localities, and made the pass of the Alps used
by Hannibal;<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> studied and transcribed the stele or bronze
tablet placed by Hannibal on the Lacinian promontory;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
travelled through Libya, Spain, Gaul, and the seas which
washed their shores (perhaps even as far as Britain), in order to
give a true account of them.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Conversed with Massanissa on
the character of the Carthaginians, as well as with many of the
Carthaginians themselves.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Carefully observed Carthagena.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
Inspected the records at Rhodes,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> and the Archives at Rome;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
and studied and transcribed the treaties preserved there.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
Visited Sardis,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> Alexandria,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> and Locri Epizephyrii.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> To
this, which is by no means an exhaustive account of his travels
and inquiries, may be added the fact that his intimacy with
the younger Africanus, grandson by adoption and nephew by
marriage of the elder Scipio, must have placed at his disposal
a considerable mass of information contained in the family
archives of the Scipios, as to the Hannibalian war, and especially
as to the campaigns in Spain.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>Such were some of the means by which Polybius was
enabled to obtain accurate and trustworthy information.</p>

<p>It remains to inquire how far Polybius availed himself of
<span class="sidenote">Use of previous
writers by
Polybius.</span>
the writings of others. He looks upon the
study of books as an important part of an historian&#8217;s
work, but, as we have seen, not the
most important. His practice appears to have been conformable
to his theory. The greater part of his information
he gained from personal observation and personal inquiry.
Nevertheless, some of his history must have been learnt from
books, and very little of it could have been entirely independent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</a></span>
of them. Still, as far as we have the means of judging
from the fragments of his work that have come down to us,
his obligations to his predecessors are not as extensive as that
of most of those who wrote after him; nor is the number of
those to whom he refers great.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>Of his preliminary sketch contained in books 1 and 2,
<span class="sidenote">The Punic wars.</span>
the first book, containing the account of the first
Punic war and the Mercenary war, appears to
have been derived mainly from the writings of Fabius Pictor
(b. circ. <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;260), and Philinus of Agrigentum (contemporary
and secretary of Hannibal). He complains that they were
violent partisans, the one of Rome, the other of Carthage.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
But by comparing the two, and checking both by documents
and inscriptions at Rome, he, no doubt, found sufficient material
for his purpose.</p>

<p>The second book contains an account of the origin of the
<span class="sidenote">Illyrians and
Gauls.</span>
war between Rome and Illyricum; of the
Gallic or Celtic wars from the earliest times;
and a sketch of Achaean history to the end of the Cleomenic
war. The first two of these must have been compiled
with great labour from various public documents and
family records, as well as in part from Pictor. The sketch of
<span class="sidenote">Achaia.</span>
Achaean history rested mainly, as far as it
depends on books, on the Memoirs of Aratus;
while he studied only to refute the writings of Phylarchus the
panegyrist of Cleomenes. He complains of the partiality of
Phylarchus: but in this part of the history it was perhaps
inevitable that his own views should have been coloured by
the prejudices and prepossessions of a politician, and one who
had been closely connected from boyhood with the patriotic
Achaean party, led by Philopoemen, which was ever at enmity
with all that Cleomenes did his utmost to establish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">xl</a></span></p>

<p>For his account of Sicilian affairs he had studied the works
<span class="sidenote">Sicilian history.</span>
of Timaeus of Tauromenium. Although he
accuses him bitterly, and at excessive length,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>
of all the faults of which an historian can be guilty, he yet confesses
that he found in his books much that was of assistance
to him<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> in regard both to Magna Graecia and Sicily; for which
he also consulted the writings of Aristotle, especially it appears
the now lost works on Polities (&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#953;), and Founding of
Cities (&#954;&#964;&#8055;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;). The severity of his criticism of Timaeus is
supported by later authors. He was nicknamed &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#8055;&#956;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;, in
allusion to the petulance of his criticism of others;<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> and
Plutarch attacks him for his perversion of truth and his foolish
and self-satisfied attempts to rival the best of the ancient writers,
and to diminish the credit of the most famous philosophers.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>As far as we possess his writings, we find little trace in
<span class="sidenote">Greek history.</span>
Polybius of a reference to the earliest historians.
Herodotus is not mentioned, though there may
be some indications of acquaintance with his work;<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> nor the
Sicilian Philistus who flourished about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;430. Thucydides
is mentioned once, and Xenophon three times. Polybius was
engaged in the history of a definite period, and had not much
occasion to refer to earlier times; and perhaps the epitomator,
in extracting what seemed of value, chose those parts especially
where he was the sole or best authority.</p>

<p>For the early history of Macedonia, he seems to have relied
<span class="sidenote">Macedonia.</span>
mostly on two pupils of Isocrates, Ephorus of
Cumae and Theopompus of Chios; though
the malignity of the latter deprived his authority of much
weight.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> He also studied the work of Alexander&#8217;s friend and
victim, Callisthenes; and vehemently assailed his veracity, as
others have done. More important to him perhaps were the
writings of his own contemporaries, the Rhodians Antisthenes
and Zeno; though he detects them in some inaccuracies,
which in the case of Zeno he took the trouble to correct:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">xli</a></span>and of Demetrius of Phalerum, whose writings he seems to
have greatly admired.</p>

<p>For the contemporary history of Egypt and Syria he seems
<span class="sidenote">Egypt and Syria.</span>
to have trusted principally to personal inquiry.
He expressly (<b>2</b>, <a href="#b2_37">37</a>) declines entering on the
early history of Egypt on the ground of its having been fully
done by others (referring, perhaps, to Herodotus, Manetho,
and Ptolemy of Megalopolis). For the Seleucid dynasty of
Syria he quotes no authorities.</p>

<p>On no subject does Polybius seem to have read so widely

as on geography: doubtless as preparing himself
not only for writing, but for being able to
travel with the knowledge and intelligence necessary to enable
him to observe rightly. He had studied minutely and criticised
freely the writings of Dicaearchus, Pytheas, Eudoxus,
and Eratosthenes. He was quick to detect fallacies in these
writers, and to reject their dogmatising on the possibilities of
nature; yet he does not seem to have had in an eminent degree
the topographical faculty, or the power of giving a graphic
picture of a locality. Modern research has tended rather to
strengthen than weaken our belief in the accuracy of his
descriptions, as in the case of Carthagena and the site of the
battle of Cannae; still it cannot be asserted that he is to be
classed high in the list of topographers, whether scientific or
picturesque.</p>

<p>He appears to have been fairly well acquainted with the
<span class="sidenote">General Literature.</span>
poets; but his occasions for quoting them, as
far as we have his work, are not very frequent.
He seems to have known his Homer, as every Greek was
bound to do. He quotes the Cypria of Stasinus, who, according
to tradition, was son-in-law of Homer; Hesiod, Simonides
of Ceos, Pindar, Euripides, and Epicharmus of Cos. He
quotes or refers to Plato, whom he appears chiefly to have
studied for his political theories; and certain technical writers,
such as Aeneas Tacticus, and Cleoxenos and Democlitus,
inventors of a new system of telegraphy, if they wrote it rather
than taught it practically.</p>

<p>Even allowing for the loss of so great a part of his work,
the list of authors is not a long one: and it suggests the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">xlii</a></span>
remark, which his style as well as his own professions tend to
confirm, that he was not primarily a man of letters, but a man
of affairs and action, who loved the stir of political agitation,
and unbent his mind by the excitement of travel and the
chase. Nothing moves his contempt more than the idea of
Timaeus living peaceably for fifty years at Athens, holding
aloof from all active life, and poring over the books in the
Athenian libraries as a preparation for writing history; which,
according to him, can only be worth reading when it springs,
not from rummaging Record offices, but from taking a personal
share in the political strife of the day; studying military tactics
in the camp and field; witnessing battles; questioning the
actors in great events; and visiting the sites of battles, the cities
and lands which are to be described.</p>

<h3>&sect; 3. THE ACHAEAN LEAGUE<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></h3>

<p>To the student of politics the history of Greece is chiefly
interesting as offering examples of numerous small states enjoying
complete local autonomy, yet retaining a feeling of a
larger nationality founded in a community of blood, language,
and religion; a community, that is, in the sense that, fundamentally
united in these three particulars, they yet acknowledged
variations even in them, which distinguished without
entirely separating them. From some points of view the experiment
may be regarded as having been successful. From others
it was a signal failure. Local jealousies and mutual provocations
not only continually set city against city, clan against
clan, but perpetually suggested invitations sent by one city,
or even one party in a city, to foreign potentates or peoples to
interfere in their behalf against another city or party, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">xliii</a></span>they hated or feared, but were too weak to resist. Thus we
find the Persians, Macedonians, Syrians, and Romans successively
induced to interfere in Greek politics with the assurance
that there were always some states, or some party in each state,
who would welcome them. From time to time men of larger
views had conceived the idea of creating a united Empire of
Hellas, which might present an unbroken front to the foreigner.
From time to time philosophers had preached the impossibility
of combining complete local independence with the idea of a
strong and vigorous nationality. But the true solution of the
problem had never been successfully hit upon: and after various
abortive attempts at combination, Greece was left, a helpless
collection of disjointed fragments, to fall under the intrigues
of Macedonia and Rome.</p>

<p>The Achaean league was not the first attempt at such a
formation; though it was the first that ever arrived at anything
like a complete scheme of federalism (unless the Aetolian
preceded it); and was in many respects a fresh departure in
Hellenic policy, and the first experiment in federation which
seemed to contain the elements of success. From the
earliest times certain Greek states had combined more or less
closely, or loosely, for certain specific purposes. Such were
the various Amphictyonies, and especially the Amphictyonic
league of Thermopylae and Delphi. The object of these was
primarily religious: the worship of a particular deity, the care
of a particular temple; the first condition of membership being
therefore community of blood. But though this was the
origin of their being, there were elements in their constitution
which might have developed into some form of federalism,
had it not been for the centrifugal forces that always tended to
keep Greek states apart. Thus we can conceive the idea of the
Pylagorae from the various states gradually giving rise to the
notion of a central parliament of elected representatives; and
the sphere of its activity gradually extending to matters purely
political, beginning with those which were on the borderland
of religion and politics. And, indeed, the action of the great
Amphictyonic league at times seemed to be approaching this.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">xliv</a></span></p>

<p>But the forces tending to decentralisation were always the
stronger: and though the league continued to exist for many
centuries, it became less and less political, and less and less
influential in Greece. So too with other combinations in
Greece. The community (&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957;) of the Ionians, beginning
with a common meeting for worship at the Panionium, on one
memorable occasion at least seemed for a brief space to
promise to develop into a federation for mutual succour and
defence. In the Ionian revolt in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;500, the deputies
(&#960;&#961;&#8057;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#953;) of the Ionian states met and determined to combine
against the enemy; they even went so far as to appoint
a common general or admiral. But the instinct of separation
was too strong; at the first touch of difficulty and hardship
the union was resolved into its elements.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>The constitution of the Boeotian league was somewhat
more regular and permanent. The Boeotarchs appear to have
met at regular intervals, and now and again to have succeeded
in mustering a national levy. There were also four regularly
constituted &#8220;Senates&#8221; to control them, though we know
nothing of their constitution.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> But the league had come to
nothing; partly from the resistance of the towns to the overweening
pretensions of Thebes, and later from the severity of
the treatment experienced by it at the hands of Alexander and
his successors.</p>

<p>Thessaly, again, was a loose confederacy of towns or cantons,
in which certain great families, such as the Aleuadae and
Scopadae, held the direction of their local affairs; or some
tyrannus, as Alexander of Pherae, obtained sovereign powers.
Still, for certain purposes, a connexion was acknowledged, and
a Tagus of Thessaly was appointed, with the power of summoning
a general levy of men. For a short time prior to the
Roman conquest these officers appear to have gained additional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">xlv</a></span>
importance; but Thessaly never was united enough to
be of importance, in spite of its famous cavalry, even among
Greek nations, far less to be capable of presenting a firm
front to the foreigner.</p>

<p>One other early attempt at forming something like a Panhellenic
union ought to be noticed. When the Persian invasion
of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;480 was threatening, deputies (&#960;&#961;&#8057;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#953;) met at the
Isthmus, sat there in council for some months, and endeavoured
to unite Greece against the foreigner.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> But the
one expedition which was sent solely by their instigation
proved a failure.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> And when the danger was over, principally
by the combined exertion of Athens and Sparta, this council
seems to have died a natural death. Still for a time it acted
as a supreme parliament of Greece, and assumed the power
to punish with fine or death those Greeks who had medised.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Besides these rudimentary leagues, which might, but did
not, issue in some form of Panhellenic government, there were
periods in Greek history in which the Hegemone of one state
did something towards presenting the appearance of union.
Thus Polycrates of Samos seemed at one time to be likely to
succeed in forming a great Ionian Empire. And in continental
Greece, before the Persian wars, we find Sparta occupying
the position of an acknowledged court of reference in
international questions,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>&mdash;a position in which she probably
had been preceded by Argos. And after those wars, by
means of the confederacy of Delos, formed at first for one
specific purpose&mdash;that of keeping the Aegean free of the
Persians&mdash;Athens gradually rose to the position of an imperial
city, claiming active control over the external politics of a
considerable portion of Greece and nearly all the islands (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
478-404). But this proved after all but a passing episode in
Greek history. Athens perhaps misused her power; and Sparta
took up the task with great professions, but in a spirit even
less acceptable to the Greek world than that of Athens; and
by the peace of Antalcidas (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;387) the issue of the hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</a></span>
years&#8217; struggle with Persia left one of the fairest portions of
Hellas permanently separated from the main body. Asiatic
Greece never became Hellenic again. The fall of the Persian
empire before the invasion of Alexander for a while reunited
it to a semi-Greek power; but Alexander&#8217;s death left it a prey
to warring tyrants. It lost its prosperity and its commerce;
and whatever else it became, it was never independent, or really
Hellenic again.</p>

<p>For a few years more Sparta and then Thebes assumed to
be head of Greece, but the Macedonian supremacy secured at
Chaeronea (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;338), still more fully after the abortive Lamian
war (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;323), left Greece only a nominal freedom, again and
again assured to it by various Macedonian monarchs, but
really held only on sufferance. The country seemed to settle
down without farther struggle into political insignificance.
The games and festivals went on, and there was still some
high talk of Hellenic glories. But one after another of the
towns submitted to receive Macedonian garrisons and governors;
and Athens, once the brilliant leader in national aspirations,
practically abandoned politics, and was content to enjoy
a reputation partly founded on her past, and partly on the
fame of the philosophers who still taught in her gardens and
porches, and attracted young men from all parts of the world to
listen to their discourses, and to sharpen their wits by the acute
if not very useful discussions which they promoted.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Sparta,
far from retaining her old ascendency, had been losing with it
her ancient constitution, which had been the foundation of
her glory, as well perhaps as in some respects the source of
her weakness; and for good or evil had ceased to count for
much in Hellenic politics.</p>

<p>In the midst of this general collapse two portions of the
Hellenic race gradually formed or recovered some sort of
united government, which enabled them to play a conspicuous
part in the later history of Greece, and which was essentially
different from any of the combinations of earlier times of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">xlvii</a></span>which I have been speaking. These were the Aetolians and
Achaeans.</p>

<p>With regard to the former our information is exceedingly
<span class="sidenote">Aetolian league.</span>
scanty. They were said to have been an emigration
from Elis originally;<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> but they were
little known to the rest of Greece. Strange stories were told
of them, of their savage mode of life, their scarcely intelligible
language, their feeding on raw flesh, and their fierceness as
soldiers. They were said to live in open villages, widely
removed from each other, and without effective means of
combination for mutual protection. Their piracies, which were
chiefly directed to the coasts of Messenia, caused the Messenians
to seize the opportunity of Demosthenes being in their
neighbourhood in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;426, with a considerable Athenian army,
to persuade him to invade the Aetolians, who were always on
the look-out to attack Naupactus, a town which the Athenians
had held since <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;455,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> and which was naturally an object
of envy to them as commanding the entrance to the Corinthian
gulf. But when Demosthenes attempted the invasion,
he found to his cost that the Aetolians knew how to combine,
and he had to retire beaten with severe loss.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> The separate
tribes in Aetolia seem soon afterwards to have had, if they
had not already, some form of central government; for we find
them negotiating with Agesilaus in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;390, with the same
object of obtaining Naupactus,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> when the Athenians had lost
it, and it had fallen into the hands of the Locrians.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> The
Aetolians appear to have gradually increased in importance:
for we find Philip making terms with them and giving them
the coveted Naupactus in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;341, which had at some time
previous come into the possession of the Achaeans.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> But
their most conspicuous achievement, which caused them to
take a position of importance in Greece, was their brilliant
defeat of the invading Gauls at Delphi in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;279.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> By this
time their federal constitution must in some shape have
been formed. The people elected a Strategus in a general
meeting, usually held at Thermus, at the autumn equinox,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">xlviii</a></span>
to which apparently all Aetolians were at liberty to come,
and at which questions of peace and war and external politics
generally were brought forward; though meanwhile the Strategus
appears to have had the right of declaring and carrying on war
as he chose. There was also a hipparch and a secretary
(<b>21</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b21_22">22</a>); and a senate called Apocleti (<b>20</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b20_1">1</a>); and a body
called <i>Synedri</i> (<i>C. I. G.</i> 2350), which seem to have been
judicial, and another called <i>Nomographi</i> (<b>13</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b13_1">1</a>, <i>C. I. G.</i>
3046), who were apparently an occasional board for legislation.
They produced some writers, but their works are lost.
Accordingly, as Professor Mahaffy observes, &#8220;we know them
entirely from their enemies.&#8221; Still the acknowledged principle
on which they acted, &#7940;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#955;&#8049;&#966;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#955;&#945;&#966;&#8059;&#961;&#959;&#965;<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>&mdash;that is, that
where spoils were going, whether from friend or foe, they
were justified in taking a part, speaks for itself, and is enough
to stamp them as at least dangerous and unpleasant neighbours.</p>

<p>The Achaeans have a different and more interesting <span class="sidenote">Achaean league.</span>
history.</p>

<p>The original Achaean league consisted of a federation of
twelve cities and their respective territory (&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#962;): Pellene,
Aegira, Aegae, Bura, Helice, Aegium, Rhypes, Patrae, Pharae,
Olenus, Dyme, Tritaea.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> This league was of great antiquity,
but we know nothing of its history, or how it differed from
other leagues, such as I have already mentioned, in adding
political to religious unity. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;454 it submitted to Athens;
but was restored to its original position in the same year on the
signing of the thirty years&#8217; truce between Sparta and Athens;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
and though the Athenians demanded that their authority over
it should be restored to them in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;425, when they had
caught the Spartan army at Sphacteria, no change appears
to have been made.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Thucydides certainly seems to speak
of it, not as entirely free, but as in some special manner
subject to the supremacy of Sparta. Polybius, however,
claims for them, at an early period, a peculiar and honourable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">xlix</a></span>place in Greek politics, as being distinguished for probity and
honour. Thus they were chosen as arbitrators in the intestine
of Magna Graecia (about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;400-390); and again,
after the battle of Leuctra (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;371) to mediate between
Sparta and Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> They must therefore, between <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;425-390,
have obtained a virtual independence. They shared,
however, in the universal decline of Hellenic activity during
the Macedonian period (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 359 to about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 285), and
Polybius complains that they were systematically depressed by
the intrigues of Sparta and Macedonia; both which powers
took care to prevent any Achaean of promising ability from
attaining influence in the Peloponnese.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> The same influence
was exerted to estrange the Achaean cities from each other.
They were garrisoned by Macedonian troops, or fell under the
power of tyrants; and to all appearance the league had fared
as other such combinations had fared before, and had been
resolved into its original elements.</p>

<p>But the tradition of the old union did not die out entirely.
Eight of the old cities still existed in a state of
more or less vigour. <span class="sidenote">Revival of the
league,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;284-280.</span>
Olenus and Helice had
long ago disappeared by encroachments of the
sea (before <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;371), and their places had not been filled up
by others. Two other towns, Rhypes and Aegae, had from
various causes ceased to be inhabited, and their places had
been taken in the league (before the dissolution) by Leontium
and Caryneia. There were therefore ten cities which had once
known the advantages and disadvantages of some sort of federal
union; as well as the misfortunes which attached to disunion,
aggravated by constant interference from without.</p>

<p>The first step in an attempt to resuscitate the league was
taken in the 124th Olympiad (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;284-280). Macedonia
was at the time weakened by the troubles of a disputed succession:
Pyrrhus was absorbed in his futile Italian expedition: <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;284.
First union of
Dyme, Patrae,
Tritaea, Pharae.</span>
a change in the sovereign of Egypt opened a
way to a possible change of policy at Alexandria:
and the death of Lysimachus gave the monarchs
something else to do than to trouble themselves
about the Peloponnese. At this period four of the Achaean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">l</a></span>
towns, Dyme, Patrae, Tritaea, and Pharae, formed a league
for mutual help. <span class="sidenote">Adherence of
Aegium, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;279.</span>
This proving, after a trial of five years, to
have some stability, it was joined by Aegium,
from which the Macedonian garrison was expelled.
At intervals, of which we are not informed,
this was again joined by Bura and Caryneia. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;279-255.</span>
These
seven cities continued to constitute the entire
league for twenty-five years; the federal magistrates
consisting of two Strategi, elected by each city in turns,
and a secretary. As to the doings of the league during this
period we are entirely in the dark. <span class="sidenote">Margos of
Caryneia first sole
Strategus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;255.</span>
The next
step that we hear of is the abolition of the dual
presidency and the election of Margos of
Caryneia as sole Strategus. We are not told
the reasons of the change; but it is clear that a divided command
might often give room for delay, when delay was fatal;
and for the conflict of local interests, where the interests of the
community should be the paramount consideration. At any
rate the change was made: and Margos, who had been a loyal
servant of the league, was the first sole Strategus. His
immediate successors we do not know. The next fact in the
history of the league was the adherence of Sicyon, a powerful
town and the first of any, not in the number of the old
Achaean federation, to join. This therefore was a great step in
the direction of extending the federation over the Peloponnese;
and it was the work of the man destined to do much in moulding
the league into the shape in which it attained its greatest
effectiveness, Aratus of Sicyon. He found it weak; its cities
poor and insignificant; with no aid from rich soil or good
harbourage to increase its wealth or property;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> he left it, not
indeed free from serious dangers and difficulties,&mdash;in part the
result of his own policy in calling in the aid of the Macedonians,
in part created by the persistent hostility of Aetolia
and Sparta,&mdash;but yet possessed of great vitality, and fast becoming
the most powerful and influential of all the Greek
governments; although at no time can it be spoken of as
Panhellenic without very considerable exaggeration. Aratus
had been brought up in exile at Argos, after the murder of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">li</a></span>father Cleinias (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;271); and, when twenty years of age, by a
gallant and romantic adventure, had driven out the tyrant
Nicocles from Sicyon (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;251). He became the chief magistrate
of his native town, which he induced to join the Achaean
league, thus causing, as I have said, the league to take its
first step towards embracing all the Peloponnese. It seems that
for five years Aratus remained chief magistrate of Sicyon, but
a private citizen of the league. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;245 (though of the
exact year we have no positive information), he appears to
have been first elected Strategus of the league. But it was
not until his second year of office, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;243-242, that he began
putting in practice the policy which he proposed to himself,&mdash;the
expulsion of the Macedonian garrisons and the despots
from the cities of the Peloponnese, with the view of their joining
the league. He began with the Acrocorinthus. Corinth,
freed from the foreign garrison, joined the league, and was
followed soon after by Megara<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;240). From this time
Aratus was Strategus of the league in alternate years to the
time of his death, the federal law not allowing two consecutive
years of office.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>The death of Antigonus Gonatas (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;239) led to a new
departure. Hitherto the Aetolians had been in league with
the Macedonians to vex and harry the Achaeans. The two
leagues now made peace, and the Aetolians aided the
Achaeans in their resistance to Gonatas&#8217;s successor, Demetrius
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;239-229). Still the despots in many of the Peloponnesian
towns held out, trusting to the support of Demetrius.
When he died (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;229) there was a general movement among
them to abdicate and join their cities to the league. Lydiades
of Megalopolis had done so during Demetrius&#8217;s lifetime; and
now Aristomachus of Argos, Xeno of Hermione, and Cleonymus
of Phlius did the same. The rapid extension of the Achaean
league, however, could not fail to excite the jealousy of the
Aetolians, to whose league belonged certain Arcadian cities
such as Mantinea, Tegea, and Orchomenus. These they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">lii</a></span>imagined to be threatened by the policy of Aratus, which was
apt to proceed on the line that even a forcible attachment of a
Peloponnesian town to the league was in reality a liberation of
its people from a constraining power. The Spartan jealousy was
aroused by the same fear. And then, as Polybius puts it, the
Aetolians connived at the extension of Spartan power, even at
the expense of cities in league with themselves, in order to
strengthen Cleomenes in his attitude of opposition to the
Achaeans.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Aratus, however, resolved to wait for some
definite act of hostility before moving. This was supplied by
Cleomenes building a fort (the Athenaeum) at Belbina, in the
territory of Megalopolis, a league city. <span class="sidenote">Cleomenic war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;227-221.</span>
Upon
this the league necessarily proclaimed war with
Sparta. Thus does Polybius, a warm friend of
the league, state the case in its behalf. The league, he argues,
had been growing by the voluntary adherence of independent
towns: it had shown no sign of an intention to attack Laconian
territory, or towns in league with Aetolia: while Cleomenes
had committed an act of wanton aggression and provocation by
building a hostile fort in its territory. But what the other side
had to say may be gathered from Plutarch&#8217;s life of Cleomenes,
founded principally on the work of Phylarchus the panegyrist
of Cleomenes.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Here the case is put very differently.
Aratus, according to him, had made up his mind that a union
of the Peloponnesus was the one thing necessary for the safety
of the league. In a great measure he had been already successful;
but the parts which still stood aloof were Elis, Laconia,
and the cities of Arcadia which were under the influence of
Sparta.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> He therefore harassed these last by every means
in his power; and the erection or fortification of the Athenaeum
at Belbina by Cleomenes was in truth only a measure of necessary
defence. Aratus, indeed, held that some of these Arcadian
cities had been unfairly seized by Cleomenes, with the connivance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">liii</a></span>
of the Aetolians;<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> but to this Cleomenes might reply
that, if the league claimed the right of extending its connexion
with the assent, often extorted, of the various cities annexed,
the same right could not justly be denied to himself. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;226-221.</span>A series
of military operations took place during the next
five years, in which Cleomenes nearly always
got the better of Aratus; who, able and courageous in plots
and surprises, was timid and ineffective in the field. The one
important blow struck by Aratus, that of seizing Mantinea,
was afterwards nullified by a counter-occupation of it by the
Lacedaemonians; and in spite of troubles at home, caused by
his great scheme of reform, Cleomenes was by <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;224 in so
superior a position that he could with dignity propose terms to
the league. He asked to be elected Strategus, therefore.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
At first sight this seemed a means of effecting the desired
union of the Peloponnese; and as such the Achaeans were inclined
to accept the proposal. Aratus, however, exerted all
his influence to defeat the measure: and, in spite of all his
failures, his services to the league enabled him to convince his
countrymen that they should reject the offer; and he was himself
elected Strategus for the twelfth time in the spring of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
223. Aratus has been loudly condemned for allowing a
selfish jealousy to override his care for the true interests of his
country, in thus refusing a prospect of a united Achaia, in which
some one besides himself should be the leading man.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> But I
think there is something to be said on the other side. What
Aratus had been working for with a passionate eagerness was
a union of free democratic states. Cleomenes, in spite of his
liberal reforms at home, was a Spartan to the back bone.
Aratus would have no manner of doubt that a league, with
Sparta supreme in it, would inevitably become a Spartan kingdom.
The forces of Sparta would be used to crush dissenting
cities; and soon to put down the free institution which would
always be disliked and feared by the Spartan government. Security
from Macedonian influence, if it were really obtained,&mdash;and
that was far from certain,&mdash;would be dearly purchased at the
price of submission to Spartan tyranny, which would be more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">liv</a></span>galling and oppressive in proportion as it was nearer and more
unremitting. With these views Aratus began to turn his eyes
to the Macedonian court, as the only possible means of resisting
the encroaching policy of Cleomenes. The character of
Antigonus Doson, who was then administering Macedonia,
gave some encouragement to hope for honest and honourable
conduct on his part; and after some hesitation Aratus took
the final step of asking for his aid.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> I do not expect to carry
the assent of many readers when I express the opinion that he
was right; and that the Greek policy towards Macedonia had
been from the first a grievous error,&mdash;fostered originally by the
patriotic eloquence of Demosthenes, and continued ever since by
that ineradicable sentiment for local autonomy which makes
Greek history so interesting, but inevitably tended to the political
annihilation of Greece. Had some <i>modus vivendi</i> been
found with the series of very able sovereigns who ruled Macedonia,
a strong Greek nation might have been the result, with a
central government able to hold its own even in the face of the
great &#8220;cloud in the West,&#8221; which was surely overshadowing
Greek freedom. But this was not to be. The taste for local
freedom was too strong; and showed itself by constant appeals
to an outside power against neighbours, which yet the very
men who appealed to it would not recognise or obey. The
Greeks had to learn that nations cannot, any more than individuals,
eat their cake and have it too. Local autonomy, and
the complete liberty of every state to war with its neighbours
as it chooses, and of every one to speak and act as he pleases,
have their charms; but they are not compatible with a united
resistance to a great centralised and law-abiding power. And
all the eloquence of all the Greek orators rolled into one could
not make up for the lack of unity, or enable the distracted
Greeks to raise an army which might stand before a volley of
Roman pila or a charge of Roman legionaries.</p>

<p>The help asked of Antigonus Doson was given with fatal
readiness; but it had to be purchased by the admission of a
Macedonian garrison into the Acrocorinthus, one of those
&#8220;fetters of Greece,&#8221; the recovery of which had been among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">lv</a></span>Aratus&#8217;s earliest and most glorious triumphs. The battle of
Sellasia (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;221) settled the question of Spartan influence.
Cleomenes fled to Alexandria and never returned. Sparta
was not enslaved by Antigonus; who on the contrary professed
to restore her ancient constitution,&mdash;probably meaning
that the Ephoralty destroyed by Cleomenes was to be reconstituted,
and the exiles banished by him recalled. Practically
she was left a prey to a series of unscrupulous tyrants who one
after the other managed to obtain absolute power, Lycurgus
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220-210), Machanidas, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;210-207; Nabis, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;207-192;
who, though differing in their home administrations, all
agreed in using the enmity of the Aetolians in order to harass
and oppress the Achaeans in every possible way.</p>

<p>Aratus died in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;213. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;213.
Death of Aratus.</span>
The last seven years of his life
were embittered by much ill success in his
struggles with the Aetolians; and by seeing
Philip V., of whose presence in the Peloponnese
he was the main cause, after rendering some brilliant
services to the league, both in the Peloponnese and the invasion
of Aetolia, develop some of the worst vices of the
tyrant; and he believed himself, whether rightly or wrongly,
to be poisoned by Philip&#8217;s order: &#8220;This is the reward,&#8221; he
said to an attendant when he felt himself dying, &#8220;of my friendship
for Philip.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>The history of the league after his death followed the
same course for some years. The war with the Aetolians
went on, sometimes slackly, sometimes vigorously, as Philip V.
was or was not diverted by contests with his barbarian neighbours,
or by schemes for joining the Carthaginian assaults
upon the Roman power.</p>

<p>The next phase of vigorous action on the part of the
league is that which corresponds with the
career of Philopoemen, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;208-183, Philopoemen.</span>
who had already shown
his energy and skill at the battle of Sellasia.
He was elected Hipparch in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;210, and Strategus in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
209. In his first office he did much to reorganise the
Achaean cavalry and restore them to some discipline,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> and he
extended this as Strategus to the whole army.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> His life&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">lvi</a></span>
work, however, was the defeating and either killing or confining
to their frontier the tyrants of Sparta. But while he was
absent from the country after <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;200 a new element appeared
in the Peloponnese. In 197 the battle of Cynoscephalae
put an end for ever to Macedonian influence, and Flamininus
proclaimed the liberty of all Greece in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;195 at the Nemean
festival. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;195-194.</span>
But Nabis was not deposed; he was
secured in his power by a treaty with Rome;
and when Philopoemen returned from Crete (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;193), he
found a fresh war on the point of breaking out owing to intrigues
between that tyrant and the Aetolians. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;193.</span>
They suggested, and he eagerly undertook to
make, an attempt to recover the maritime towns of which he
had been deprived by the Roman settlement.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a><span class="sidenote">193-192.</span>Nabis at once
attacked Gythium: and seemed on the point
of taking it and the whole of the coast towns,
which would thus have been lost to the league. Philopoemen,
now again Strategus (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;192), failed to relieve Gythium;
but by a skilful piece of generalship inflicted so severe a defeat
on Nabis, as he was returning to Sparta, that he did not
venture on further movements beyond Laconia; and shortly
afterwards was assassinated by some Aetolians whom he had
summoned to his aid.</p>

<p>But the comparative peace in the Peloponnese was again broken in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
189 <span class="sidenote">189-187.</span>by the Spartans seizing a maritime town called
Las; the object being to relieve themselves of the restraint which shut
them from the sea, and the possible attacks of the exiles who had been
banished by Nabis, and who were always watching an opportunity to effect
their return. Philopoemen (Strategus both 189 and 188 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) led an army
to the Laconian frontier in the spring of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;188, and after the
execution of eighty Spartans, who had been surrendered on account of the
seizure of Las, and of the murder of thirty citizens who were supposed
to have Achaean proclivities&mdash;Sparta submitted to his demand to raze the
fortifications, dismiss the mercenaries, send away the new citizens
enrolled by the tyrants, and abolish the Lycurgean laws, accepting the
Achaean institutions instead. This was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">lvii</a></span>
afterwards supplemented by a demand for the restoration of the
exiles banished by the tyrants. Such of the new citizens (three
thousand) as did not leave the country by the day named
were seized and sold as slaves.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>Sparta was now part of the Achaean league, which at this
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;188.</span>
time reached its highest point of power; and its
alliance was solicited by the most powerful
princes of the east. <span class="sidenote">188-183.</span>It is this period which Polybius seems
to have in mind in his description of the league
at its best, as embracing the whole of the
Peloponnese.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a><span class="sidenote">Lycortas
Strategus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;184-182.</span>was in this third period of the existence
of the renewed league that his father Lycortas
came to the front, and he himself at an early
age began taking part in politics.</p>

<p>But the terms imposed on Sparta were essentially violent
and unjust, and, as it turned out, impolitic. Cowed into submission,
she proved a thorn in the side of the league. The
exiles continually appealed to Rome; and after Philopoemen&#8217;s
death (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;183) the affairs of the league began more and more
to come before the Roman Senate. As usual, traitors were at
hand ready to sell their country for the sake of the triumph
of their party; and Callicrates, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;179.</span>sent to Rome to
plead the cause of the league,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> employed the
opportunity to support himself and his party by advising the
Senate to give support to &#8220;the Romanisers&#8221; in every state.
This Polybius regards as the beginning of the decline of the
league. And the party of moderation, to which he and his
father Lycortas belonged, and which wished to assert the
dignity and legal rights of their country while offering no
provocation to the Romans, were eventually included under
the sweeping decree which caused them, to the number of a
thousand, to be deported to Italy. We have already seen, in
tracing the life of Polybius, how the poor remnants of these
exiles returned in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;151, embittered against Rome, and
having learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. And how the
old quarrels were renewed, until an armed interference of
Rome was brought upon them; and how the victory of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">lviii</a></span>
Mummius at Corinth (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146), and the consequent settlement
of the commissioners, finally dissolved the league into separate
cantons, nominally autonomous, but really entirely subject to
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>The constitution of the league presents many points of
interest to the student of politics, and has been elaborately
discussed by more than one English scholar. I shall content
myself here with pointing out some of the main features as
they are mentioned by Polybius.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>The league was a federation of free towns, all retaining
full local autonomy of some form or other of democracy,
which for certain purposes were under federal laws and federal
magistrates, elected in a federal assembly which all citizens of
the league towns might if they chose attend. All towns of the
league also used the same standards in coinage and weights and
measures (<b>2</b>, <a href="#b2_37">37</a>). The assembly of the league (&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962;) met
for election of the chief magistrate in May of each year, at first
always at Aegium, but later at the other towns of the league
in turn (<b>29</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b29_23">23</a>); and a second time in the autumn.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> And
besides these annual meetings, the Strategus, acting with his
council of magistrates, could summon a meeting at any time for
three days (<i>e.g.</i> at Sicyon, <b>23</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b23_17">17</a>); and on one occasion we
find the assembly delegating its powers to the armed levy of
league troops, who for the nonce were to act as an assembly
(<b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_7">7</a>). Side by side with this general assembly was a council
(&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8053;), the functions and powers of which we cannot clearly
ascertain. It seems to have acted as representing the general
assembly in foreign affairs (<b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_26">26</a>; <b>22</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b22_12">12</a>); and, being a
working committee of the whole assembly, it sometimes happened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">lix</a></span>
that when an assembly was summoned on some subject
which did not rouse popular interest, it practically was the
assembly (<b>29</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b29_24">24</a>). Its numbers have been assumed to be
one hundred and twenty, from the fact that Eumenes offered
them a present of one hundred and twenty talents, the interest
of which was to pay their expenses. But this, after all, is not
a certain deduction (<b>22</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b22_10">10</a>).</p>

<p>The officers of the league were: First, a President or
Strategus who kept the seal of the league (<b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_7">7</a>), ordered the
levy of federal troops, and commanded it in the field. He
also summoned the assemblies, and brought the business to
be done before them, which was in the form of a proposal to
be accepted or rejected, not amended. He was not chairman of
the assembly, but like an English minister or a Roman consul
brought on the proposals. He was assisted by a kind of
cabinet of ten magistrates from the several towns, who were
called Demiurgi (&#948;&#951;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#8054; <b>23</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b23_5">5</a>).<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> This was their technical
name: but Polybius also speaks of them under the more
general appellation of &#959;&#7985; &#7940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; (<b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_1">1</a>), &#959;&#7985; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#8049;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;
(<b>23</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b23_16">16</a>), &#945;&#7985; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; (<b>22</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b22_13">13</a>), &#945;&#7985; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#8055;&#945;&#953; (<b>27</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b27_2">2</a>). Whether
the number ten had reference to the ten old towns of the
league or not, it was not increased with the number of the
towns; and, though we are not informed how they were elected,
it seems reasonable to suppose that they were freely selected
without reference to the towns from which they came, as the
Strategus himself was. There was also a vice-president, or
hypo-strategus, whose position was, I think, wholly military.
He did not rule in absence of the Strategus, or succeed him in
case of death, that being reserved for the Strategus of the
previous year; but he took a certain command in war next
the Strategus (<b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_94">94</a>; <b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_59">59</a>). Besides these we hear of a
Hipparch to command the league cavalry (<b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_95">95</a>; <b>7</b>, <b>10</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b10_22">22</a>), an
office which seems to have been regarded as stepping-stone to
that of Strategus. This proved a bad arrangement, as its
holder was tempted to seek popularity by winking at derelictions
of duty among the cavalry who were voters.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> There was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">lx</a></span>
also a Navarch to command the regular squadron of federal
ships (<b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_94">94</a>), who does not seem to have been so important
a person. There are also mentioned certain judges (&#948;&#8055;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;)
to administer the federal law. We hear of them, however,
performing duties closely bordering on politics; for they decided
whether certain honorary inscriptions, statues, or other marks
of respect to king Eumenes should be allowed to remain in
the Achaean cities (<b>28</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b28_7">7</a>).</p>

<p>The Strategus, on the order of the assembly, raised the
federal army (<b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_7">7</a>). The number of men raised differed
according to circumstances. A fairly full levy seems to have
been five thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry (<b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_15">15</a>).
But the league also used mercenaries to a great extent. And
we hear of one army which was to consist of eight thousand
mercenary infantry, with five hundred mercenary cavalry; and
in this case the Achaean levy was only to be three thousand
infantry, with three hundred cavalry (<b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_91">91</a>).</p>

<p>The pay of the mercenaries and other league expenses
were provided for by an &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8049; or contribution from all the
states (<b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_31">31</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b5_91">91</a>). The contributing towns appear to have
been able to recover their payments as an indemnification for
damage which the federal forces had failed to avert (<b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_60">60</a>).</p>

<p>The regular federal squadron of ships for guarding the sea-coasts
appears to have consisted of ten triremes
(<b>2</b>, <a href="#b2_9">9</a>; &#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#8055;&#945; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#955;&#959;&#8055;&#969;&#957; <b>22</b>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44126/44126-h/44126-h.htm#b22_10">10</a>).</p>

<p>Such was the organisation of the Federal Government. It
was in form purely democratic, all members of thirty years old
being eligible for office, as well as possessing a vote in the
assemblies. But a mass assembly where the members are
widely scattered inevitably becomes oligarchic. Only the well-to-do
and the energetic will be able or will care to come a
long journey to attend. And as the votes in the assembly
were given by towns, it must often have happened that the
votes of many towns were decided by a very small number of
their citizens who were there. No doubt, in times of great
excitement, the attendance would be large and the vote a
popular one. But the general policy of the league must
have been directed by a small number of energetic men, who
made politics their profession and could afford to do so.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">THE HISTORIES OF POLYBIUS</h2>

<h2>BOOK I</h2>

<p><a name="b1_1" id="b1_1"><b>1.</b></a> <span class="smcap">Had</span> the praise of History been passed over by former Chroniclers it
<span class="sidenote">Introduction. The importance and magnitude of the subject.</span>
would perhaps have been incumbent upon me to urge the choice and special
study of records of this sort, as the readiest means men can have of
correcting their knowledge of the past. But my predecessors have not
been sparing in this respect. They have all begun and ended, so to
speak, by enlarging on this theme: asserting again and again that the
study of History is in the truest sense an education, and a training for
political life; and that the most instructive, or rather the only,
method of learning to bear with dignity the vicissitudes of fortune is
to recall the catastrophes of others. It is evident, therefore, that no
one need think it his duty to repeat what has been said by many, and
said well. Least of all myself: for the surprising nature of the events
which I have undertaken to relate is in itself sufficient to challenge
and stimulate the attention of every one, old or young, to the study of
my work. Can any one be so indifferent or idle as not to care to know by
what means, and under what kind of polity, almost the whole inhabited
world was conquered and brought under the dominion of the single city of
Rome, and that too within a period of not quite fifty-three years?
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219-167.</span>Or who again can be so completely absorbed in
other subjects of contemplation or study, as to think any of them
superior in importance to the accurate understanding of an event for
which the past affords no precedent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b1_2" id="b1_2"><b>2.</b></a> We shall best show how marvellous and vast our subject <span class="sidenote">
Immensity of the Roman Empire shown by comparison with Persia, Sparta,
Macedonia. 1. Persia.</span>is by comparing the most famous Empires which
preceded, and which have been the favourite themes of historians, and
measuring them with the superior greatness of Rome. There are but three
that deserve even to be so compared and measured: and they are these.
The Persians for a certain length of time were possessed of a great
empire and dominion. <span class="sidenote">2. Sparta. <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;405-394.</span>But every time
they ventured beyond the limits of Asia, they found not only their
empire, but their own existence also in danger. The Lacedaemonians,
after contending for supremacy in Greece for many generations, when they
did get it, held it without dispute for barely twelve years. <span class="sidenote">
3. Macedonia.</span>The Macedonians obtained dominion in Europe from the
lands bordering on the Adriatic to the Danube,&mdash;which after all is but a
small fraction of this continent,&mdash;and, by the destruction of the
Persian Empire, they afterwards added to that the dominion of Asia. And
yet, though they had the credit of having made themselves masters of a
larger number of countries and states than any people had ever done,
they still left the greater half of the inhabited world in the hands of
others. They never so much as thought of attempting Sicily, Sardinia, or
Libya: and as to Europe, to speak the plain truth, they never even knew
of the most warlike tribes of the West. The Roman conquest, on the other
hand, was not partial. Nearly the whole inhabited world was reduced by
them to obedience: and they left behind them an empire not to be
paralleled in the past or rivalled in the future. Students will gain
from my narrative a clearer view of the whole story, and of the numerous
and important advantages which such exact record of events offers.</p>

<p><a name="b1_3" id="b1_3"><b>3.</b></a> My History begins in the 140th Olympiad. The events from which it starts are these. In
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220-217. The
History starts from the 140th Olympiad, when the tendency towards unity
first shows itself.</span>
Greece, what is called the Social war: the first waged by Philip, son of
Demetrius and father of Perseus, in league with the Achaeans against the
Aetolians. In Asia, the war for the possession of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span> Coele-Syria which
Antiochus and Ptolemy Philopator carried on against each other. In
Italy, Libya, and their neighbourhood, the conflict between Rome and
Carthage, generally called the Hannibalian war. My work thus begins
where that of Aratus of Sicyon leaves off. Now up to this time the
world&#8217;s history had been, so to speak, a series of disconnected
transactions, as widely separated in their origin and results as in
their localities. But from this time forth History becomes a connected
whole: the affairs of Italy and Libya are involved with those of Asia
and Greece, and the tendency of all is to unity. This is why I have
fixed upon this era as the starting-point of my work. For it was their
victory over the Carthaginians in this war, and their conviction that
thereby the most difficult and most essential step towards universal
empire had been taken, which encouraged the Romans for the first time to
stretch out their hands upon the rest, and to cross with an army into
Greece and Asia.</p>

<p>Now, had the states that were rivals for universal empire been
familiarly known to us, <span class="sidenote">A sketch of their previous history
necessary to explain the success of the Romans.</span>no reference perhaps to
their previous history would have been necessary, to show the purpose
and the forces with which they approached an undertaking of this nature
and magnitude. But the fact is that the majority of the Greeks have no
knowledge of the previous constitution, power, or achievements either of
Rome or Carthage. I therefore concluded that it was necessary to prefix
this and the next book to my History. I was anxious that no one, when
fairly embarked upon my actual narrative, should feel at a loss, and
have to ask what were the designs entertained by the Romans, or the
forces and means at their disposal, that they entered upon those
undertakings, which did in fact lead to their becoming masters of land
and sea everywhere in our part of the world. I wished, on the contrary,
that these books of mine, and the prefatory sketch which they contained,
might make it clear that the resources they started with justified their
original idea, and sufficiently explained their final success in
grasping universal empire and dominion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b1_4" id="b1_4"><b>4.</b></a> There is this analogy between the plan of my History and the
marvellous spirit of the age with which I have to deal. <span class="sidenote">The
need of a comprehensive view of history as well as a close study of an
epoch.</span>Just as Fortune made almost all the affairs of the world incline
in one direction, and forced them to converge upon one and the same
point; so it is my task as an historian to put before my readers a
compendious view of the part played by Fortune in bringing about the
general catastrophe. It was this peculiarity which originally challenged
my attention, and determined me on undertaking this work. And combined
with this was the fact that no writer of our time has undertaken a
general history. Had any one done so my ambition in this direction would
have been much diminished. But, in point of fact, I notice that by far
the greater number of historians concern themselves with isolated wars
and the incidents that accompany them: while as to a general and
comprehensive scheme of events, their date, origin, and catastrophe, no
one as far as I know has undertaken to examine it. I thought it,
therefore, distinctly my duty neither to pass by myself, nor allow any
one else to pass by, without full study, a characteristic specimen of
the dealings of Fortune at once brilliant and instructive in the highest
degree. For fruitful as Fortune is in change, and constantly as she is
producing dramas in the life of men, yet never assuredly before this did
she work such a marvel, or act such a drama, as that which we have
witnessed. And of this we cannot obtain a comprehensive view from
writers of mere episodes. It would be as absurd to expect to do so as
for a man to imagine that he has learnt the shape of the whole world,
its entire arrangement and order, because he has visited one after the
other the most famous cities in it; or perhaps merely examined them in
separate pictures. That would be indeed absurd: and it has always seemed
to me that men, who are persuaded that they get a competent view of
universal from episodical history, are very like persons who should see
the limbs of some body, which had once been living and beautiful,
scattered and remote; and should imagine that to be quite as good as
actually beholding the activity and beauty of the living creature
itself. But if some one could there and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> reconstruct the animal
once more, in the perfection of its beauty and the charm of its
vitality, and could display it to the same people, they would beyond
doubt confess that they had been far from conceiving the truth, and had
been little better than dreamers. For indeed some idea of a whole may be
got from a part, but an accurate knowledge and clear comprehension
cannot. Wherefore we must conclude that episodical history contributes
exceedingly little to the familiar knowledge and secure grasp of
universal history. While it is only by the combination and comparison of
the separate parts of the whole,&mdash;by observing their likeness and their
difference,&mdash;that a man can attain his object: can obtain a view at once
clear and complete; and thus secure both the profit and the delight of
History.</p>

<p><a name="b1_5" id="b1_5"><b>5.</b></a> I shall adopt as the starting-point of this book the first occasion
on which the Romans crossed the sea from Italy. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;264-261.
I begin my preliminary account in the 129th Olympiad, and with the
circumstances which took the Romans to Sicily.</span>This is just where the
History of Timaeus left off; and it falls in the 129th Olympiad. I shall
accordingly have to describe what the state of their affairs in Italy
was, how long that settlement had lasted, and on what resources they
reckoned, when they resolved to invade Sicily. For this was the first
place outside Italy in which they set foot. The precise cause of their
thus crossing I must state without comment; for if I let one cause lead
me back to another, my point of departure will always elude my grasp,
and I shall never arrive at the view of my subject which I wish to
present. As to dates, then, I must fix on some era agreed upon and
recognised by all: and as to events, one that admits of distinctly
separate treatment; even though I may be obliged to go back some short
way in point of time, and take a summary review of the intermediate
transactions. For if the facts with which one starts are unknown, or
even open to controversy, all that comes after will fail of approval and
belief. But opinion being once formed on that point, and a general
assent obtained, all the succeeding narrative becomes intelligible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b1_6" id="b1_6"><b>6.</b></a> It was in the nineteenth year after the sea-fight at Aegospotami, and
the sixteenth before the battle at Leuctra; <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;387-386. The
rise of the Roman dominion may be traced from the retirement of the
Gauls from the city. From that time one nation after another in Italy
fell into their hands.</span>the year in which the Lacedaemonians made what
is called the Peace of Antalcidas with the King of Persia; the year in
which the elder Dionysius was besieging Rhegium after beating the
Italian Greeks on the River Elleporus; and in which the Gauls took Rome
itself by storm and were occupying the whole of it except the Capitol.
With these Gauls the Romans made a treaty and settlement which they were
content to accept: and having thus become beyond all expectation once
more masters of their own country, they made a start in their career of
expansion; and in the succeeding period engaged in various wars with
their neighbours. <span class="sidenote">The Latini.</span>First, by dint of valour, and
the good fortune which attended them in the field, they mastered all the
Latini; then they went to war with the Etruscans; <span class="sidenote">The
Etruscans, Gauls, and Samnites.</span>then with the Celts; and next with the
Samnites, who lived on the eastern and northern frontiers of Latium.
Some time after this the Tarentines insulted the ambassadors of Rome,
and, in fear of the consequences, invited and obtained the assistance of
Pyrrhus. <span class="sidenote">Pyrrhus, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;280.</span>This happened in the year before
the Gauls invaded Greece, some of whom perished near Delphi, while
others crossed into Asia. Then it was that the Romans&mdash;having reduced
the Etruscans and Samnites to obedience, and conquered the Italian Celts
in many battles&mdash;attempted for the first time the reduction of the rest
of Italy. <span class="sidenote">Southern Italy.</span>The nations for whose possessions
they were about to fight they affected to regard, not in the light of
foreigners, but as already for the most part belonging and pertaining to
themselves. The experience gained from their contests with the Samnites
and the Celts had served as a genuine training in the art of war.
<span class="sidenote">Pyrrhus finally quits Italy, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;274.</span>Accordingly, they
entered upon the war with spirit, drove Pyrrhus from Italy, and then
undertook to fight with and subdue those who had taken part with him.
They succeeded everywhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span> to a marvel, and reduced to obedience all the
tribes inhabiting Italy except the Celts; after which they undertook to
besiege some of their own citizens, who at that time were occupying
Rhegium.</p>

<p><a name="b1_7" id="b1_7"><b>7.</b></a> For misfortunes befell Messene and Rhegium, the cities built on
either side of the Strait, peculiar in <span class="sidenote">The story of the
Mamertines at Messene, and the Roman garrison at Rhegium, Dio. Cassius
<i>fr.</i></span> their nature and alike in their circumstances.</p>

<p>Not long before the period we are now describing some Campanian
mercenaries of Agathocles, having for some time cast greedy eyes upon
Messene, owing to its beauty and wealth, no sooner got an opportunity
than they made a treacherous attempt upon that city. <span class="sidenote">1.
Messene.</span>They entered the town under guise of friendship, and, having
once got possession of it, they drove out some of the citizens and put
others to the sword. <span class="sidenote">Agathocles died, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;289.</span> This done,
they seized promiscuously the wives and children of the dispossessed
citizens, each keeping those which fortune had assigned him at the very
moment of the lawless deed. All other property and the land they took
possession of by a subsequent division and retained.</p>

<p>The speed with which they became masters of a fair territory and city
found ready imitators of their conduct. <span class="sidenote">2. Rhegium, Livy Ep.
12.</span>The people of Rhegium, when Pyrrhus was crossing to Italy, felt a
double anxiety. They were dismayed at the thought of his approach, and
at the same time were afraid of the Carthaginians as being masters of
the sea. <span class="sidenote">Pyrrhus in Sicily, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;278-275.</span>They accordingly
asked and obtained a force from Rome to guard and support them. The
garrison, four thousand in number, under the command of a Campanian
named Decius Jubellius, entered the city, and for a time preserved it,
as well as their own faith. But at last, conceiving the idea of
imitating the Mamertines, and having at the same time obtained their
co-operation, they broke faith with the people of Rhegium, enamoured of
the pleasant site of the town and the private wealth of the citizens,
and seized the city after having, in imitation of the Mamertines, first
driven out some of the people and put others to the sword. Now, though
the Romans were much annoyed at this transaction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> they could take no
active steps, because they were deeply engaged in the wars I have
mentioned above. But having got free from them they invested and
besieged the troops. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;271. C. Quintus Claudius, L. Genucius
Clepsina, Coss.</span>They presently took the place and killed the greater
number in the assault,&mdash;for the men resisted desperately, knowing what
must follow,&mdash;but took more than three hundred alive. These were sent to
Rome, and there the Consuls brought them into the forum, where they were
scourged and beheaded according to custom: for they wished as far as
they could to vindicate their good faith in the eyes of the allies. The
territory and town they at once handed over to the people of Rhegium.</p>

<p><a name="b1_8" id="b1_8"><b>8.</b></a> But the Mamertines (for this was the name which the Campanians gave
themselves after they became masters of Messene), <span class="sidenote">Effect of
the fall of the rebellious garrison of Rhegium on the Mamertines.</span>as
long as they enjoyed the alliance of the Roman captors of Rhegium, not
only exercised absolute control over their own town and district
undisturbed, but about the neighbouring territory also gave no little
trouble to the Carthaginians and Syracusans, and levied tribute from
many parts of Sicily. But when they were deprived of this support, the
captors of Rhegium being now invested and besieged, they were themselves
promptly forced back into the town again by the Syracusans, under
circumstances which I will now detail.</p>

<p>Not long before this the military forces of the Syracusans had
quarrelled with the citizens, and while stationed near Mergan&egrave; elected
commanders from their own body. <span class="sidenote">The rise of Hiero. He is
elected General by the army, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;275-274.</span>These were Artemidorus and
Hiero, the latter of whom afterwards became King of Syracuse. At this
time he was quite a young man, but had a certain natural aptitude for
kingcraft and the politic conduct of affairs. Having taken over the
command, and having by means of some of his connexions made his way into
the city, he got his political opponents into his hands; but conducted
the government with such mildness, and in so lofty a spirit, that the
Syracusans, though by no means usually acquiescing in the election of
officers by the soldiers, did on this occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span> unanimously approve of
Hiero as their general. His first step made it evident to close
observers that his hopes soared above the position of a mere general.</p>

<p><a name="b1_9" id="b1_9"><b>9.</b></a> He noticed that among the Syracusans the despatch of troops, and of
magistrates in command of them, was always the signal for revolutionary
movements of some sort or another. <span class="sidenote">Secures support of Leptines
by marrying his daughter.</span>He knew, too, that of all the citizens
Leptines enjoyed the highest position and credit, and that among the
common people especially he was by far the most influential man
existing. He accordingly contracted a relationship by marriage with him,
that he might have a representative of his interests left at home at
such times as he should be himself bound to go abroad with the troops
for a campaign. After marrying the daughter of this man, his next step
was in regard to the old mercenaries. <span class="sidenote">His device for getting
rid of mutinous mercenaries.</span>He observed that they were disaffected and
mutinous: and he accordingly led out an expedition, with the ostensible
purpose of attacking the foreigners who were in occupation of Messene.
He pitched a camp against the enemy near Centuripa, and drew up his line
resting on the River Cyamosorus. <span class="sidenote">Fiume Salso.</span>But the cavalry
and infantry, which consisted of citizens, he kept together under his
personal command at some distance, on pretence of intending to attack
the enemy on another quarter: the mercenaries he thrust to the front and
allowed them to be completely cut to pieces by the foreigners; while he
seized the moment of their rout to affect a safe retreat for himself and
the citizens into Syracuse. This stroke of policy was skilful and
successful. He had got rid of the mutinous and seditious element in the
army; and after enlisting on his own account a sufficient body of
mercenaries, he thenceforth carried on the business of the government in
security. But seeing that the Mamertines <span class="sidenote">Hiero next attacks
the Mamertines and defeats them near Mylae, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;268.</span>were encouraged
by their success to greater confidence and recklessness in their
excursions, he fully armed and energetically drilled the citizen levies,
led them out, and engaged the enemy on the Mylaean plain near the River
Longanus. He inflicted a severe defeat upon them:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> took their leaders
prisoners: put a complete end to their audacious proceedings: and on his
return to Syracuse was himself greeted by all the allies with the title
of King.</p>

<p><a name="b1_10" id="b1_10"><b>10.</b></a> Thus were the Mamertines first deprived of support from Rhegium, and
then subjected, from causes which I have just stated, to a complete
defeat on their own account. <span class="sidenote">Some of the conquered Mamertines
appeal to Rome for help.</span>Thereupon some of them betook themselves to
the protection of the Carthaginians, and were for putting themselves and
their citadel into their hands; while others set about sending an
embassy to Rome to offer a surrender of their city, and to beg
assistance on the ground of the ties of race which united them. The
Romans were long in doubt. The inconsistency of sending such aid seemed
manifest. A little while ago they had put some of their own citizens to
death, with the extreme penalties of the law, for having broken faith
with the people of Rhegium: and now so soon afterwards to assist the
Mamertines, <span class="sidenote">The motives of the Romans in acceding to this
prayer,&mdash;jealousy of the growing power of Carthage.</span>who had done
precisely the same to Messene as well as Rhegium, involved a breach of
equity very hard to justify. But while fully alive to these points, they
yet saw that Carthaginian aggrandisement was not confined to Libya, but
had embraced many districts in Iberia as well; and that Carthage was,
besides, mistress of all the islands in the Sardinian and Tyrrhenian
seas: they were beginning, therefore, to be exceedingly anxious lest, if
the Carthaginians became masters of Sicily also, they should find them
very dangerous and formidable neighbours, surrounding them as they would
on every side, and occupying a position which commanded all the coasts
of Italy. Now it was clear that, if the Mamertines did not obtain the
assistance they asked for, the Carthaginians would very soon reduce
Sicily. For should they avail themselves of the voluntary offer of
Messene and become masters of it, they were certain before long to crush
Syracuse also, since they were already lords of nearly the whole of the
rest of Sicily. The Romans saw all this, and felt that it was absolutely
necessary not to let Messene slip, or allow the Carthaginians to secure
what would be like a bridge to enable them to cross into Italy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b1_11" id="b1_11"><b>11.</b></a> In spite of protracted deliberations, the conflict of motives proved
too strong, <span class="sidenote">The Senate shirk the responsibility of decision.
The people vote for helping the Mamertines.</span>after all, to allow of the
Senate coming to any decision; for the inconsistency of aiding the
Messenians appeared to them to be evenly balanced by the advantages to
be gained by doing so. The people, however, had suffered much from the
previous wars, and wanted some means of repairing the losses which they
had sustained in every department. Besides these national advantages to
be gained by the war, the military commanders suggested that
individually they would get manifest and important benefits from it.
They accordingly voted in favour of giving the aid. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;264.
Appius Claudius Caudex. M. Fulvius Flaccus, Coss.</span>The decree having
thus been passed by the people, they elected one of the consuls, Appius
Claudius, to the command, and sent him out with instructions to cross to
Messene and relieve the Mamertines. These latter managed, between
threats and false representations, to oust the Carthaginian commander
who was already in possession of the citadel, invited Appius in, and
offered to deliver the city into his hands. The Carthaginians crucified
their commander for what they considered to be his cowardice and folly
in thus losing the citadel; stationed their fleet near Pelorus; their
land forces at a place called Synes; and laid vigorous siege to Messene.
<span class="sidenote">Hiero joins Carthage in laying siege to the Mamertines in
Messene. Appius comes to the relief of the besieged, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;264.</span>Now at
this juncture Hiero, thinking it a favourable opportunity for totally
expelling from Sicily the foreigners who were in occupation of Messene,
made a treaty with the Carthaginians. Having done this, he started from
Syracuse upon an expedition against that city. He pitched his camp on
the opposite side to the Carthaginians, near what was called the
Chalcidian Mount, whereby the garrison were cut off from that way out as
well as from the other. The Roman Consul Appius, for his part, gallantly
crossed the strait by night and got into Messene. But he found that the
enemy had completely surrounded the town and were vigorously pressing on
the attack; and he concluded on reflection that the siege could bring
him neither credit nor security so long as the enemy commanded land as
well as sea. He accordingly first endeavoured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> to relieve the Mamertines
from the contest altogether by sending embassies to both of the
attacking forces. <span class="sidenote">After vain attempts at negotiation, Appius
determines to attack Hiero.</span>Neither of them received his proposals, and
at last, from sheer necessity, he made up his mind to hazard an
engagement, and that he would begin with the Syracusans. So he led out
his forces and drew them up for the fight: nor was the Syracusan
backward in accepting the challenge, but descended simultaneously to
give him battle. <span class="sidenote">Hiero is defeated, and returns to Syracuse.</span>
After a prolonged struggle, Appius got the better of the enemy, and
chased the opposing forces right up to their entrenchments. The result
of this was that Appius, after stripping the dead, retired into Messene
again, while Hiero, with a foreboding of the final result, only waited
for nightfall to beat a hasty retreat to Syracuse.</p>

<p><a name="b1_12" id="b1_12"><b>12.</b></a> Next morning, when Appius was assured of their flight, his
confidence was strengthened, and he made up his mind to attack the
Carthaginians without delay. <span class="sidenote">Encouraged by this success, he
attacks and drives off the Carthaginians.</span>Accordingly, he issued orders
to the soldiers to despatch their preparations early, and at daybreak
commenced his sally. Having succeeded in engaging the enemy, he killed a
large number of them, and forced the rest to fly precipitately to the
neighbouring towns. These successes sufficed to raise the siege of
Messene: and thenceforth he scoured the territory of Syracuse and her
allies with impunity, and laid it waste without finding any one to
dispute the possession of the open country with him; and finally he sat
down before Syracuse itself and laid siege to it.</p>

<p>Such was the nature and motive of the first warlike expedition of the
Romans beyond the shores of Italy; <span class="sidenote">Such preliminary sketches
are necessary for clearness, and my readers must not be surprised if I
follow the same system in the case of other towns.</span>and this was the
period at which it took place. I thought this expedition the most
suitable starting-point for my whole narrative, and accordingly adopted
it as a basis; though I have made a rapid survey of some anterior
events, that in setting forth its causes no point should be left
obscure. I thought it necessary, if we were to get an adequate and
comprehensive view of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span> their present supreme position, to trace clearly
how and when the Romans, after the disaster which they sustained in the
loss of their own city, began their upward career; and how and when,
once more, after possessing themselves of Italy, they conceived the idea
of attempting conquests external to it. This must account in future
parts of my work for my taking, when treating of the most important
states, a preliminary survey of their previous history. In doing so my
object will be to secure such a vantage-ground as will enable us to see
with clearness from what origin, at what period, and in what
circumstances they severally started and arrived at their present
position. This is exactly what I have just done with regard to the
Romans.</p>

<p><a name="b1_13" id="b1_13"><b>13.</b></a> It is time to have done with these explanations, and to come to my
subject, after a brief and summary statement of the events of which my
introductory books are to treat. <span class="sidenote">Subjects of the two first
books of the Histories.<br />1. War in Sicily or first Punic War, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
264-241.<br />2. The Mercenary or &#8220;inexpiable&#8221; war, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;240-237.<br />3.
Carthaginian movements in Spain, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;241-218.<br />4. Illyrian war, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
229-228.<br />5. Gallic war, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;225-221.<br />6. Cleomenic war, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;227-221.</span>
Of these the first in order of time are those which befell the Romans
and Carthaginians in their war for the possession of Sicily. Next comes
the Libyan or Mercenary war; immediately following on which are the
Carthaginian achievements in Spain, first under Hamilcar, and then under
Hasdrubal. In the course of these events, again, occurred the first
expedition of the Romans into Illyria and the Greek side of Europe; and,
besides that, their struggles within Italy with the Celts. In Greece at
the same time the war called after Cleomenes was in full action. With
this war I design to conclude my prefatory sketch and my second book.</p>

<p>To enter into minute details of these events is unnecessary, and would
be of no advantage to my readers. It is not part of my plan to write a
history of them: my sole object is to recapitulate them in a summary
manner by way of introduction to the narrative I have in hand. I will,
therefore, touch lightly upon the leading events of this period in a
comprehensive sketch, and will endeavour to make the end of it dovetail
with the commencement of my main history. In this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> way the narrative
will acquire a continuity; and I shall be shown to have had good reason
for touching on points already treated by others: while by such an
arrangement the studiously inclined will find the approach to the story
which has to be told made intelligible and easy for them. <span class="sidenote">The
first Punic war deserves more detailed treatment, as furnishing a better
basis for comparing Rome and Carthage than subsequent wars.</span>I shall,
however, endeavour to describe with somewhat more care the first war
which arose between the Romans and Carthaginians for the possession of
Sicily. For it would not be easy to mention any war that lasted longer
than this one; nor one in which the preparations made were on a larger
scale, or the efforts made more sustained, or the actual engagements
more numerous, or the reverses sustained on either side more signal.
Moreover, the two states themselves were at the precise period of their
history when their institutions were as yet in their original integrity,
their fortunes still at a moderate level, and their forces on an equal
footing. So that those who wish to gain a fair view of the national
characteristics and resources of the two had better base their
comparison upon this war rather than upon those which came after.</p>

<p><a name="b1_14" id="b1_14"><b>14.</b></a> But it was not these considerations only which induced me to
undertake the history of this war. <span class="sidenote">This is rendered more
necessary by the partisan misrepresentations of Philinus and Fabius
Pictor.</span>I was influenced quite as much by the fact that Philinus and
Fabius, who have the reputation of writing with the most complete
knowledge about it, have given us an inadequate representation of the
truth. Now, judging from their lives and principles, I do not suppose
that these writers have intentionally stated what was false; but I think
that they are much in the same state of mind as men in love.
Partisanship and complete prepossession made Philinus think that all the
actions of the Carthaginians were characterised by wisdom, honour, and
courage: those of the Romans by the reverse. Fabius thought the exact
opposite. Now in other relations of life one would hesitate to exclude
such warmth of sentiment: for a good man ought to be loyal to his
friends and patriotic to his country; ought to be at one with his
friends in their hatreds and likings. But directly a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> assumes the
moral attitude of an historian he ought to forget all considerations of
that kind. There will be many occasions on which he will be bound to
speak well of his enemies, and even to praise them in the highest terms
if the facts demand it: and on the other hand many occasions on which it
will be his duty to criticise and denounce his own side, however dear to
him, if their errors of conduct suggest that course. For as a living
creature is rendered wholly useless if deprived of its eyes, so if you
take truth from History what is left is but an idle unprofitable tale.
Therefore, one must not shrink either from blaming one&#8217;s friends or
praising one&#8217;s enemies; nor be afraid of finding fault with and
commending the same persons at different times. For it is impossible
that men engaged in public affairs should always be right, and unlikely
that they should always be wrong. Holding ourselves, therefore, entirely
aloof from the actors, we must as historians make statements and
pronounce judgment in accordance with the actions themselves.</p>

<p><a name="b1_15" id="b1_15"><b>15.</b></a> The writers whom I have named exemplify the truth of these
remarks. <span class="sidenote">Philinus&#8217;s misrepresentations.</span>Philinus, for
instance, commencing the narrative with his second book, says that the
&#8220;Carthaginians and Syracusans engaged in the war and sat down before
Messene; that the Romans arriving by sea entered the town, and
immediately sallied out from it to attack the Syracusans; but that after
suffering severely in the engagement they retired into Messene; and that
on a second occasion, having issued forth to attack the Carthaginians,
they not only suffered severely but lost a considerable number of their
men captured by the enemy.&#8221; But while making this statement, he
represents Hiero as so destitute of sense as, after this engagement, not
only to have promptly burnt his stockade and tents and fled under cover
of night to Syracuse, but to have abandoned all the forts which had been
established to overawe the Messenian territory. Similarly he asserts
that &#8220;the Carthaginians immediately after their battle evacuated their
entrenchment and dispersed into various towns, without venturing any
longer even to dispute the possession of the open country; and that,
accordingly, their leaders seeing that their troops were utterly
demoralised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> determined in consideration not to risk a battle: that the
Romans followed them, and not only laid waste the territory of the
Carthaginians and Syracusans, but actually sat down before Syracuse
itself and began to lay siege to it.&#8221; These statements appear to me to
be full of glaring inconsistency, and to call for no refutation at all.
The very men whom he describes to begin with as besieging Messene, and
as victorious in the engagements, he afterwards represents as running
away, abandoning the open country, and utterly demoralised: while those
whom he starts by saying were defeated and besieged, he concludes by
describing as engaging in a pursuit, as promptly seizing the open
places, and finally as besieging Syracuse. Nothing can reconcile these
statements. It is impossible. Either his initial statement, or his
account of the subsequent events, must be false. In point of fact the
latter part of his story is the true one. The Syracusans and
Carthaginians <i>did</i> abandon the open country, and the Romans <i>did</i>
immediately afterwards commence a siege of Syracuse and of Echetla,
which lies in the district between the Syracusan and Carthaginian pales.
For the rest it must necessarily be acknowledged that the first part of
his account is false; and that whereas the Romans were victorious in the
engagements under Messene, they have been represented by this historian
as defeated. Through the whole of this work we shall find Philinus
acting in a similar spirit: and much the same may be said of Fabius, as
I shall show when the several points arise.</p>

<p>I have now said what was proper on the subject of this
digression. Returning to the matter in hand I will endeavour
by a continuous narrative of moderate dimensions to guide
my readers to a true knowledge of this war.</p>

<p><a name="b1_16" id="b1_16"><b>16.</b></a> When news came to Rome of the successes of Appius and his
legions, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;264.</span>the people elected Manius Otacilius and
Manius Valerius Consuls, and despatched their whole army to Sicily, and
both Consuls in command. <span class="sidenote">(Continuing from chap. xii.), <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
263, Manius Valerius Maximus, Manius Otacilius Crassus, Coss. The
Consuls with four legions are sent to Sicily. A general move of the
Sicilian cities to join them. Hiero submits.</span>Now the Romans have in
all, as distinct from allies, four legions of Roman citizens, which they
enrol every year, each of which consists of four thousand infantry and
three hundred cavalry: and on their arrival most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> of the cities revolted
from Syracuse as well as from Carthage, and joined the Romans. And when
he saw the terror and dismay of the Sicilians, and compared with them
the number and crushing strength of the legions of Rome, Hiero began,
from a review of all these points, to conclude that the prospects of the
Romans were brighter than those of the Carthaginians. Inclining
therefore from these considerations to the side of the former, he began
sending messages to the Consuls, proposing peace and friendship with
them. The Romans accepted his offer, their chief motive being the
consideration of provisions: for as the Carthaginians had command of the
sea, they were afraid of being cut off at every point from their
supplies, warned by the fact that the legions which had previously
crossed had run very short in that respect. They therefore gladly
accepted Hiero&#8217;s offers of friendship, supposing that he would be of
signal service to them in this particular. The king engaged to restore
his prisoners without ransom, and to pay besides an indemnity of a
hundred talents of silver. The treaty being arranged on these terms, the
Romans thenceforth regarded the Syracusans as friends and allies: while
King Hiero, having thus placed himself under the protection of the
Romans, never failed to supply their needs in times of difficulty; and
for the rest of his life reigned securely in Syracuse, devoting his
energies to gaining the gratitude and good opinion of the Greeks. And in
point of fact no monarch ever acquired a greater reputation, or enjoyed
for a longer period the fruits of his prudent policy in private as well
as in public affairs.</p>

<p><a name="b1_17" id="b1_17"><b>17.</b></a> When the text of this treaty reached Rome, and the people had
approved and confirmed the terms made with Hiero, <span class="sidenote">The
Carthaginians alarmed at Hiero&#8217;s defection make great efforts to
increase their army in Sicily.</span>the Roman government thereupon decided
not to send all their forces, as they had intended doing, but only two
legions. For they thought that the gravity of the war was lessened by
the adhesion of the king, and at the same time that the army would thus
be better off for provisions. But when the Carthaginian government saw
that Hiero had become their enemy, and that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> Romans were taking a
more decided part in Sicilian politics, they conceived that they must
have a more formidable force to enable them to confront their enemy and
maintain their own interests in Sicily. <span class="sidenote">They select Agrigentum
as their headquarters.</span>Accordingly, they enlisted mercenaries from over
sea&mdash;a large number of Ligurians and Celts, and a still larger number of
Iberians&mdash;and despatched them to Sicily. And perceiving that Agrigentum
possessed the greatest natural advantages as a place of arms, and was
the most powerful city in their province, they collected their supplies
and their forces into it, deciding to use this city as their
headquarters for the war.</p>

<p>On the Roman side a change of commanders had now taken place. <span class="sidenote">
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;262.</span>The Consuls who made the treaty with Hiero had gone home, and
their successors, Lucius Postumius and Quintus Mamilius, were come to
Sicily with their legions. <span class="sidenote">The new Consuls, Lucius Postumius
Megellus and Quintus Mamilius Vitulus, determined to lay siege to
Agrigentum.</span>Observing the measure which the Carthaginians were taking,
and the forces they were concentrating at Agrigentum, they made up their
minds to take that matter in hand and strike a bold blow. Accordingly
they suspended every other department of the war, and bearing down upon
Agrigentum itself with their whole army, attacked it in force; pitched
their camp within a distance of eight stades from the city; and confined
the Carthaginians within the walls. <span class="sidenote">The Carthaginians make an
unsuccessful sally.</span>Now it was just harvest-time, and the siege was
evidently destined to be a long one: the soldiers, therefore, went out
to collect the corn with greater hardihood than they ought to have done.
Accordingly the Carthaginians, seeing the enemy scattered about the
fields, sallied out and attacked the harvesting-parties. They easily
routed these; and then one portion of them made a rush to destroy the
Roman entrenchment, the other to attack the pickets. But the peculiarity
of their institutions saved the Roman fortunes, as it had often done
before. Among them it is death for a man to desert his post, or to fly
from his station on any pretext whatever. Accordingly on this, as on
other occasions, they gallantly held their ground against opponents many
times their own number; and though they lost many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> their own men,
they killed still more of the enemy, and at last outflanked the foes
just as they were on the point of demolishing the palisade of the camp.
Some they put to the sword, and the rest they pursued with slaughter
into the city.</p>

<p><a name="b1_18" id="b1_18"><b>18.</b></a> The result was that thenceforth the Carthaginians were
somewhat less forward in making such attacks, and the Romans
more cautious in foraging.</p>

<p>Finding that the Carthaginians would not come out to meet them at close
quarters any more, <span class="sidenote">The Romans form two strongly-entrenched
camps.</span>the Roman generals divided their forces: with one division they
occupied the ground round the temple of Asclepius outside the town; with
the other they encamped in the outskirts of the city on the side which
looks towards Heracleia. The space between the camps on either side of
the city they secured by two trenches,&mdash;the inner one to protect
themselves against sallies from the city, the outer as a precaution
against attacks from without, and to intercept those persons or supplies
which always make their way surreptitiously into cities that are
sustaining a siege. The spaces between the trenches uniting the camps
they secured by pickets, taking care in their disposition to strengthen
the several accessible points. As for food and other war material, the
other allied cities all joined in collecting and bringing these to
Herbesus for them: and thus they supplied themselves in abundance with
necessaries, by continually getting provisions living and dead from this
town, which was conveniently near. For about five months then they
remained in the same position, without being able to obtain any decided
advantage over each other beyond the casualties which occurred in the
skirmishes. But the Carthaginians were beginning to be hard pressed by
hunger, owing to the number of men shut up in the city, who amounted to
no less than fifty thousand: and Hannibal, who had been appointed
commander of the besieged forces, beginning by this time to be seriously
alarmed at the state of things, kept perpetually sending messages to
Carthage explaining their critical state, and begging for
assistance. <span class="sidenote">A relief comes from Carthage to Agrigentum.</span>
Thereupon the Carthaginian government put on board ship the fresh troops
and elephants which they had collected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> and despatched them to Sicily,
with orders to join the other commander Hanno. This officer collected all his war material and forces into
Heracleia, and as a first step possessed himself by a stratagem of
<span class="sidenote">Hanno seizes
Herbesus.</span>Herbesus, thus depriving the enemy of their provisions and supply of
necessaries. The result of this was that the Romans found themselves in
the position of besieged as much as in that of besiegers; for they were
reduced by short supplies of food and scarcity of necessaries to such a
condition that they more than once contemplated raising the
siege. <span class="sidenote">The Romans faithfully supported by Hiero.</span>And they
would have done so at last had not Hiero, by using every effort and
contrivance imaginable, succeeded in keeping them supplied with what
satisfied, to a tolerable extent, their most pressing wants. This was
Hanno&#8217;s first step. His next was as follows.</p>

<p><a name="b1_19" id="b1_19"><b>19.</b></a> He saw that the Romans were reduced by disease and want, owing to an
epidemic that had broken out among them, and he believed that his own
forces were strong enough to give them battle: he accordingly collected
his elephants, <span class="sidenote">Hanno tempts the Roman cavalry out and defeats
them.</span>of which he had about fifty, and the whole of the rest of his
army, and advanced at a rapid pace from Heracleia; having previously
issued orders to the Numidian cavalry to precede him, and to endeavour,
when they came near the enemies&#8217; stockade, to provoke them and draw
their cavalry out; and, having done so, to wheel round and retire until
they met him. The Numidians did as they were ordered, and advanced up to
one of the camps. Immediately the Roman cavalry poured out and boldly
charged the Numidians: the Libyans retired, according to their orders,
until they reached Hanno&#8217;s division: then they wheeled round;
surrounded, and repeatedly charged the enemy; killed a great number of
them, and chased the rest up to their stockade. After this affair
Hanno&#8217;s force encamped over against the Romans, having seized the hill
called Torus, at a distance of about a mile and a quarter from their
opponents. <span class="sidenote">After two months, Hanno is forced to try to relieve
Agrigentum,</span> For two months they remained in position without any
decisive action, though skirmishes took place daily. But as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> Hannibal
all this time kept signalling and sending messages from the town to
Hanno,&mdash;telling him that his men were impatient of the famine, and that
many were even deserting to the enemy owing to the distress for
food,&mdash;the Carthaginian general determined to risk a battle, the Romans
being equally ready, <span class="sidenote">but is defeated in a pitched battle, and
his army cut to pieces.</span>for the reasons I have mentioned. So both
parties advanced into the space between the camps and engaged. The
battle lasted a long time, but at last the Romans turned the advanced
guard of Carthaginian mercenaries. The latter fell back upon the
elephants and the other divisions posted in their rear; and thus the
whole Punic army was thrown into confusion. The retreat became general:
the larger number of the men were killed, while some effected their
escape into Heracleia; and the Romans became masters of most of the
elephants and all the baggage. Now night came on, and the victors,
partly from joy at their success, partly from fatigue, kept their
watches somewhat more carelessly than usual; <span class="sidenote">Hannibal escapes
by night; and the Romans enter and plunder Agrigentum.</span>accordingly
Hannibal, having given up hope of holding out, made up his mind that
this state of things afforded him a good opportunity of escape. He
started about midnight from the town with his mercenary troops, and
having choked up the trenches with baskets stuffed full of chaff, led
off his force in safety, without being detected by the enemy. When day
dawned the Romans discovered what had happened, and indeed for a short
time were engaged with Hannibal&#8217;s rear; but eventually they all made for
the town gates. There they found no one to oppose them: they therefore
threw themselves into the town, plundered it, and secured a large number
of captives, besides a great booty of every sort and description.</p>

<p><a name="b1_20" id="b1_20"><b>20.</b></a> Great was the joy of the Roman Senate when the news of what had
taken place at Agrigentum arrived. <span class="sidenote">This success inspires the
Senate with the idea of expelling the Carthaginians from Sicily.</span>Their
ideas too were so raised that they no longer confined themselves to
their original designs. They were not content with having saved the
Mamertines, nor with the advantages gained in the course of the war; but
conceived the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> idea that it was possible to expel the Carthaginians
entirely from the island, and that if that were done their own power
would receive a great increase: they accordingly engaged in this policy
and directed their whole thoughts to this subject. As to their land
forces they saw that things were going on as well as they could
wish. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;261.</span>For the Consuls elected in succession to
those who had besieged Agrigentum, Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Titus
Otacilius Crassus, appeared to be managing the Sicilian business as well
as circumstances admitted. Yet so long as the Carthaginians were in
undisturbed command of the sea, the balance of success could not incline
decisively in their favour. For instance, in the period which followed,
though they were now in possession of Agrigentum, and though
consequently many of the inland towns joined the Romans from dread of
their land forces, yet a still larger number of seaboard towns held
aloof from them in terror of the Carthaginian fleet. Seeing therefore
that it was ever more and more the case that the balance of success
oscillated from one side to the other from these causes; and, moreover,
that while Italy was repeatedly ravaged by the naval force, Libya
remained permanently uninjured; they became eager to get upon the sea
and meet the Carthaginians there.</p>

<p>It was this branch of the subject that more than anything
else induced me to give an account of this war at somewhat
greater length than I otherwise should have done. I was
unwilling that a first step of this kind should be unknown,&mdash;namely
how, and when, and why the Romans first started a navy.</p>

<p>It was, then, because they saw that the war they had undertaken lingered
to a weary length, <span class="sidenote">The Romans boldly determine to build ships
and meet the Carthaginians at sea.</span>that they first thought of getting a
fleet built, consisting of a hundred quinqueremes and twenty triremes.
But one part of their undertaking caused them much difficulty. Their
shipbuilders were entirely unacquainted with the construction of
quinqueremes, because no one in Italy had at that time employed vessels
of that description. There could be no more signal proof of the courage,
or rather the extraordinary audacity of the Roman enterprise. Not only
had they no resources for it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> of reasonable sufficiency; but without any
resources for it at all, and without having ever entertained an idea of
naval war,&mdash;for it was the first time they had thought of it,&mdash;they
nevertheless handled the enterprise with such extraordinary audacity,
that, without so much as a preliminary trial, they took upon themselves
there and then to meet the Carthaginians at sea, on which they had for
generations held undisputed supremacy. Proof of what I say, and of their
surprising audacity, may be found in this. When they first took in hand
to send troops across to Messene they not only had no decked vessels but
no war-ships at all, not so much as a single galley: but they borrowed
quinqueremes and triremes from Tarentum and Locri, and even from Elea
and Neapolis; and having thus collected a fleet, boldly sent their men
across upon it. <span class="sidenote">A Carthaginian ship used as a model.</span>It was
on this occasion that, the Carthaginians having put to sea in the Strait
to attack them, a decked vessel of theirs charged so furiously that it
ran aground, and falling into the hands of the Romans served them as a
model on which they constructed their whole fleet. And if this had not
happened it is clear that they would have been completely hindered from
carrying out their design by want of constructive knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="b1_21" id="b1_21"><b>21.</b></a> Meanwhile, however, those who were charged with the shipbuilding
were busied with the construction of the vessels; while others collected
crews and were engaged in teaching them to row on dry land: which they
contrived to do in the following manner. They made the men sit on
rower&#8217;s benches on dry land, in the same order as they would sit on the
benches in actual vessels: in the midst of them they stationed the
Celeustes, and trained them to get back and draw in their hands all
together in time, and then to swing forward and throw them out again,
and to begin and cease these movements at the word of the Celeustes. By
the time these preparations were completed the ships were built. They
therefore launched them, and, after a brief preliminary practice of real
sea-rowing, started on their coasting voyage along the shore of Italy,
in accordance with the Consul&#8217;s order. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;260. Cn. Cornelius
Scipio Asina, C. Duilius, Coss.</span>For Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, who had
been appointed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> Roman people a few days before to command the
fleet, after giving the ship captains orders that as soon as they had
fitted out the fleet they should sail to the Straits, had put to sea
himself with seventeen ships and sailed in advance to Messene; for he
was very eager to secure all pressing necessaries for the naval force.
While there some negotiation was suggested to him for the surrender of
the town of Lipara. <span class="sidenote">Cornelius captured with the loss of his
ships.</span>Snatching at the prospect somewhat too eagerly, he sailed with
the above-mentioned ships and anchored off the town. But having been
informed in Panormus of what had taken place, the Carthaginian general
Hannibal despatched Bo&#333;des, a member of the Senate, with a squadron
of twenty ships. He accomplished the voyage at night and shut up Gnaeus
and his men within the harbour. When day dawned the crews made for the
shore and ran away, while Gnaeus, in utter dismay, and not knowing in
the least what to do, eventually surrendered to the enemy. The
Carthaginians having thus possessed themselves of the ships as well as
the commander of their enemies, started to rejoin Hannibal. <span class="sidenote">
The rest of the Roman fleet arrive and nearly capture Hannibal.</span>Yet a
few days afterwards, though the disaster of Gnaeus was so signal and
recent, Hannibal himself was within an ace of falling into the same
glaring mistake. For having been informed that the Roman fleet in its
voyage along the coast of Italy was close at hand, he conceived a wish
to get a clear view of the enemy&#8217;s number and disposition. He
accordingly set sail with fifty ships, and just as he was rounding the
&#8220;Italian Headland&#8221; he fell in with the enemy, who were sailing in good
order and disposition. He lost most of his ships, and with the rest
effected his own escape in a manner beyond hope or expectation.</p>

<p><a name="b1_22" id="b1_22"><b>22.</b></a> When the Romans had neared the coasts of Sicily and
learnt the disaster which had befallen Gnaeus, their first step
was to send for Gaius Duilius, who was in command of the
land forces. Until he should come they stayed where they
were; but at the same time, hearing that the enemy&#8217;s fleet was
no great way off, they busied themselves with preparations
for a sea-fight. Now their ships were badly fitted out and
not easy to manage, and so some one suggested to them as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
likely to serve their turn in a fight the construction of what
were afterwards called &#8220;crows.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">The &#8220;corvi&#8221; or
#8220;crows&#8221; for
boarding.</span>Their mechanism
was this. A round pole was placed in the
prow, about twenty-four feet high, and with a
diameter of four palms. The pole itself had a pulley on the
top, and a gangway made with cross planks nailed together,
four feet wide and thirty-six feet long, was made to swing round
it. Now the hole in the gangway was oval shaped, and went
round the pole twelve feet from one end of the gangway, which
had also a wooden railing running down each side of it to
the height of a man&#8217;s knee. At the extremity of this gangway
was fastened an iron spike like a miller&#8217;s pestle,
sharpened at its lower end and fitted with a ring at its
upper end. The whole thing looked like the machines for
braising corn. To this ring the rope was fastened with
which, when the ships collided, they hauled up the &#8220;crows,&#8221;
by means of the pulley at the top of the pole, and dropped
them down upon the deck of the enemy&#8217;s ship, sometimes over
the prow, sometimes swinging them round when the ships
collided broadsides. And as soon as the &#8220;crows&#8221; were fixed
in the planks of the decks and grappled the ships together, if
the ships were alongside of each other, the men leaped on
board anywhere along the side, but if they were prow to prow,
they used the &#8220;crow&#8221; itself for boarding, and advanced over
it two abreast. The first two protected their front by holding
up before them their shields, while those who came after
them secured their sides by placing the rims of their shields
upon the top of the railing. Such were the preparations
which they made; and having completed them they watched
an opportunity of engaging at sea.</p>

<p><a name="b1_23" id="b1_23"><b>23.</b></a> As for Gaius Duilius, he no sooner heard of the
disaster which had befallen the commander of <span class="sidenote">Victory of

the navy than handing over his legions to the
military Tribunes he transferred himself to the
fleet. There he learnt that the enemy was
plundering the territory of Mylae, and at once sailed to attack
him with the whole fleet. No sooner did the Carthaginians
sight him than with joy and alacrity they put to sea with a
hundred and thirty sail, feeling supreme contempt for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Roman ignorance of seamanship. Accordingly they all sailed
with their prows directed straight at their enemy: they did not
think the engagement worth even the trouble of ranging their
ships in any order, but advanced as though to seize a booty
exposed for their acceptance. Their commander was that
same Hannibal who had withdrawn his forces from Agrigentum
by a secret night movement, and he was on board a
galley with seven banks of oars which had once belonged to
King Pyrrhus. When they neared the enemy, and saw the
&#8220;crows&#8221; raised aloft on the prows of the several ships, the
Carthaginians were for a time in a state of perplexity; for they
were quite strangers to such contrivances as these engines.
Feeling, however, a complete contempt for their opponents,
those on board the ships that were in the van of the squadron
charged without flinching. But as soon as they came to
close quarters their ships were invariably tightly grappled
by these machines; the enemy boarded by means of the
&#8220;crows,&#8221; and engaged them on their decks; and in the end
some of the Carthaginians were cut down, while others surrendered
in bewildered terror at the battle in which they
found themselves engaged, which eventually became exactly
like a land fight. The result was that they lost the first
thirty ships engaged, crews and all. Among them was captured
the commander&#8217;s ship also, though Hannibal himself
by an unexpected piece of luck and an act of great daring
effected his escape in the ship&#8217;s boat. The rest of the Carthaginian
squadron were sailing up with the view of charging;
but as they were coming near they saw what had
happened to the ships which were sailing in the front, and
accordingly sheered off and avoided the blows of the engines.
Yet trusting to their speed, they managed by a man&oelig;uvre to
sail round and charge the enemy, some on their broadside
and others on their stern, expecting by that method to avoid
danger. But the engines swung round to meet them in
every direction, and dropped down upon them so infallibly,
that no ships could come to close quarters without being
grappled. Eventually the Carthaginians turned and fled, bewildered
at the novelty of the occurrence, and with a loss of
fifty ships.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b1_24" id="b1_24"><b>24.</b></a> Having in this unlooked-for manner made good their maritime hopes
the Romans were doubly encouraged in their enthusiasm for the war.
<span class="sidenote">Further operations in Sicily.<br /><br />Segesta and
Macella.<br /><br />Hamilcar.</span>For the present they put in upon the
coast of Sicily, raised the siege of Segesta when it was reduced to the
last extremity, and on their way back from Segesta carried the town
Macella by assault. But Hamilcar, the commander of the Carthaginian land
forces happened, after the naval battle, to be informed as he lay
encamped near Panormus that the allies were engaged in a dispute with
the Romans about the post of honour in the battles: and ascertaining
that the allies were encamped by themselves between Paropus and
Himeraean Thermae, he made a sudden attack in force as they were in the
act of moving camp and killed almost four thousand of them. <span class="sidenote">
Hannibal in Sardinia.</span>After this action Hannibal sailed across to
Carthage with such ships as he had left; and thence before very long
crossed to Sardinia, with a reinforcement of ships, and accompanied by
some of those whose reputation as naval commanders stood high. But
before very long he was blockaded in a certain harbour by the Romans,
and lost a large number of ships; and was thereupon summarily arrested
by the surviving Carthaginians and crucified. This came about because
the first thing the Romans did upon getting a navy was to try to become
masters of Sardinia.</p>

<p>During the next year the Roman legions in Sicily did nothing worthy of
mention. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;259.</span>In the next, after the arrival of the new
Consuls, Aulus Atilius and Gaius Sulpicius, they started to attack
Panormus because the Carthaginian forces were wintering there. <span class="sidenote">
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;258. Coss. A. Atilius Calatinus, G. Sulpicius, Paterculus.</span>The
Consuls advanced close up to the city with their whole force, and drew
up in order of battle. But the enemy refusing to come out to meet them,
they marched away and attacked the town of Hippana. This they carried by assault: but though they also
took Myttistratum it was only after it had stood a lengthened siege
<span class="sidenote">Hippana
and Myttistratum.</span>owing to the strength of its situation. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> was at this time, too, that
they recovered Camarina, which had revolted a short time previously.
They threw up works against it, and captured it
<span class="sidenote">Camarina.</span>after making a breach in its walls. They treated Henna, and sundry other
strong places which had been in the hands of the Carthaginians, in the
same way; and when they had finished these operations they undertook to
lay siege to Lipara.</p>

<p><a name="b1_25" id="b1_25"><b>25.</b></a> Next year Gaius Atilius, the Consul, happened to be at anchor off
Tyndaris, when he observed the Carthaginian fleet sailing by in a
straggling manner. <span class="sidenote">Coss. C. Atilius Regulus, Cn. Cornelius,
Blasio II. <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;257.<br /><br />Fighting off Tyndaris.</span>He passed the
word to the crews of his own ships to follow the advanced squadron, and
started himself before the rest with ten ships of equal sailing powers.
When the Carthaginians became aware that while some of the enemy were
still embarking, others were already putting out to sea, and that the
advanced squadron were considerably ahead of the rest, they stood round
and went to meet them. They succeeded in surrounding and destroying all
of them except the Consul&#8217;s ship, and that they all but captured with
its crew. This last, however, by the perfection of its rowers and its
consequent speed, effected a desperate escape. Meanwhile the remaining
ships of the Romans were sailing up and gradually drawing close
together. Having got into line, they charged the enemy, took ten ships
with their crews, and sunk eight. The rest of the Carthaginian ships
retired to the Liparean Islands.</p>

<p>The result of this battle was that both sides concluded that they were
now fairly matched, and accordingly made more systematic efforts to
secure a naval force, <span class="sidenote">Winter of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;257-256.</span>and to dispute
the supremacy at sea. While these things were going on, the land forces
effected nothing worth recording; but wasted all their time in such
petty operations as chance threw in their way. Therefore, after making
the preparations <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;256. Coss. L. Manlius, Vulso Longus, M.
Atilius Regulus II. (Suff.)</span>I have mentioned for the approaching
summer, the Romans, with three hundred and thirty decked ships of war,
touched at Messene; thence put to sea, keeping Sicily on their right;
and after doubling the headland Pachynus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span> passed on to Ecnomus, because
the land force was also in that district. The Carthaginians on their
part put to sea again with three hundred and fifty decked ships, touched
at Lilybaeum, and thence dropped anchor at Heracleia Minoa.</p>

<p><a name="b1_26" id="b1_26"><b>26.</b></a> Now it was the purpose of the Romans to sail across to Libya and
transfer the war there, <span class="sidenote">Preparations for the Battle of
Ecnomus.</span>in order that the Carthaginians might find the danger
affecting themselves and their own country rather than Sicily. But the
Carthaginians were determined to prevent this. They knew that Libya was
easily invaded, and that the invaders if they once effected a landing
would meet with little resistance from the inhabitants; and they
therefore made up their minds not to allow it, and were eager rather to
bring the matter to a decisive issue by a battle at sea. The one side
was determined to cross, the other to prevent their crossing; and their
enthusiastic rivalry gave promise of a desperate struggle. The
preparations of the Romans were made to suit either contingency, an
engagement at sea or a disembarkation on the enemy&#8217;s soil. Accordingly
they picked out the best hands from the land army and divided the whole
force which they meant to take on board into four divisions. Each
division had alternative titles; <span class="sidenote">Roman forces. 330 ships, with
average of 420 men (300 rowers + 120 marines) = 138,600 men.</span>the first
was called the &#8220;First Legion&#8221; or the &#8220;First Squadron,&#8221;&mdash;and so on with
the others. The fourth had a third title besides. They were called
&#8220;Triarii,&#8221; on the analogy of land armies. The total number of men thus
making up the naval force amounted to nearly one hundred and forty
thousand, reckoning each ship as carrying three hundred rowers and one
hundred and twenty soldiers. The Carthaginians, on the other hand, made
their preparations almost exclusively with a view to a naval engagement.
<span class="sidenote">Carthaginian numbers, 150,000 men.</span>Their numbers, if we
reckon by the number of their ships, were over one hundred and fifty
thousand men. The mere recital of these figures must, I should imagine,
strike any one with astonishment at the magnitude of the struggle, and
the vast resources of the contending states. An actual view of them
itself could hardly be more impressive than the bare statement of the
number of men and ships.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>Now the Romans had two facts to consider: <span class="sidenote">The Roman order
at Ecnomus.</span>First, that
circumstances compelled them to face the open
sea; and, secondly, that their enemies had the
advantage of fast sailing vessels. They therefore
took every precaution for keeping their line unbroken
and difficult to attack. They had only two ships with six
banks of oars, those, namely, on which the Consuls Marcus
Atilius and Lucius Manlius respectively were sailing. These
they stationed side by side in front and in a line with each other.
Behind each of these they stationed ships one behind the other
in single file&mdash;the first squadron behind the one, and the
second squadron behind the other. These were so arranged
that, as each ship came to its place, the two files diverged
farther and farther from each other; the vessels being also
stationed one behind the other with their prows inclining outwards.
Having thus arranged the first and second squadrons
in single file so as to form a wedge, they stationed the third
division in a single line at its base; so that the whole finally
presented the appearance of a triangle. Behind this base they
stationed the horse-transports, attaching them by towing-ropes
to the ships of the third squadron. And to the rear of them
they placed the fourth squadron, called the Triarii, in a single
line, so extended as to overlap the line in front of them at both
extremities. When these dispositions were complete the
general appearance was that of a beak or wedge, the apex of
which was open, the base compact and strong; while the
whole was easy to work and serviceable, and at the same time
difficult to break up.</p>

<p><a name="b1_27" id="b1_27"><b>27.</b></a> Meanwhile the Carthaginian commanders had briefly addressed their
men. <span class="sidenote">The disposition of the Carthaginian fleet.</span>They pointed
out to them that victory in this battle would ensure the war in the
future being confined to the question of the possession of Sicily; while
if they were beaten they would have hereafter to fight for their native
land and for all that they held dear. With these words they passed the
word to embark. The order was obeyed with universal enthusiasm, for what
had been said brought home to them the issues at stake; and they put to
sea in the full fervour of excited gallantry, which might well have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
struck terror into all who saw it. When their commanders saw the
arrangement of the enemies&#8217; ships they adapted their own to match it.
Three-fourths of their force they posted in a single line, extending
their right wing towards the open sea with a view of outflanking their
opponents, and placing their ships with prows facing the enemy; while
the other fourth part was posted to form a left wing of the whole, the
vessels being at right angles to the others and close to the shore. The
two Carthaginian commanders were Hanno and Hamilcar. <span class="sidenote">ch. 19.</span>
The former was the general who had been defeated in the engagement at
Agrigentum. He now commanded the right wing, supported by beaked vessels
for charging, and the fastest sailing quinqueremes for outflanking, the
enemy. <span class="sidenote">ch. 25.</span>The latter, who had been in the engagement
off Tyndaris, had charge of the left wing. This officer, occupying the
central position of the entire line, on this occasion employed a
stratagem which I will now describe. <span class="sidenote">The battle.</span>The battle
began by the Romans charging the centre of the Carthaginians, because
they observed that it was weakened by their great extension. The ships
in the Carthaginian centre, in accordance with their orders, at once
turned and fled with a view of breaking up the Roman close order. They
began to retire with all speed, and the Romans pursued them with
exultation. The consequence was that, while the first and second Roman
squadrons were pressing the flying enemy, the third and fourth &#8220;legions&#8221;
had become detached and were left behind,&mdash;the former because they had
to tow the horse-transports, and the &#8220;Triarii&#8221; because they kept their
station with them and helped them to form a reserve. But when the
Carthaginians thought that they had drawn the first and second squadron
a sufficient distance from the main body a signal was hoisted on board
Hamilcar&#8217;s ship, and they all simultaneously swung their ships round and
engaged their pursuers. The contest was a severe one. The Carthaginians
had a great superiority in the rapidity with which they man&oelig;uvred
their ships. They darted out from their line and rowed round the enemy:
they approached them with ease, and retired with despatch. But the
Romans, no less than the Carthaginians, had their reasons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span> for
entertaining hopes of victory: for when the vessels got locked together
the contest became one of sheer strength: their engines, the &#8220;crows,&#8221;
grappled all that once came to close quarters: and, finally, both the
Consuls were present in person and were witnesses of their behaviour in
battle.</p>

<p><a name="b1_28" id="b1_28"><b>28.</b></a> This was the state of affairs on the centre. But
meanwhile Hanno with the right wing, which had held aloof
when the first encounter took place, crossing the open sea,
charged the ships of the Triarii and caused them great
difficulty and embarrassment: while those of the Carthaginians
who had been posted near the land man&oelig;uvred into line,
and getting their ships straight, charged the men who were
towing the horse-transports. These latter let go the towing-ropes,
grappled with the enemy, and kept up a desperate
struggle.</p>

<p>So that the engagement was in three separate divisions,
or rather there were three sea-fights going on at
wide intervals from each other. <span class="sidenote">Three separate
battles.</span>Now in these
three engagements the opposing parties were in
each case fairly matched, thanks to the original disposition of
the ships, and therefore the victory was in each case closely
contested. However the result in the several cases was very
much what was to be expected where forces were so equal.
The first to engage were the first to separate: <span class="sidenote">First with Hamilcar&#8217;s
squadron.</span>
for Hamilcar&#8217;s division at last were overpowered
and fled. But while Lucius was
engaged in securing his prizes, Marcus observing the struggle
in which the Triarii and horse-transports were involved, went
with all speed to their assistance, taking with him all the
ships of the second squadron which were undamaged. <span class="sidenote">Second squadron
under Regulus.</span>
As soon as he had reached and
engaged Hanno&#8217;s division, the Triarii quickly
picked up courage, though they were then getting much
the worst of it, and returned with renewed spirits to the
fight. It was now the turn for the Carthaginians to be in
difficulties. They were charged in front and on the rear,
and found to their surprise that they were being surrounded
by the relieving squadron. They at once gave way and
retreated in the direction of the open sea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>While this was going on, Lucius, who was sailing back to
rejoin his colleague, observed that the third
squadron had got wedged in by the Carthaginians
close in shore. <span class="sidenote">Third squadron
relieved by Regulus
and Manlius.</span>
Accordingly he and
Marcus, who had by this time secured the safety of the transports
and Triarii, started together to relieve their imperilled
comrades, who were now sustaining something very like a
blockade. And the fact is that they would long before this
have been utterly destroyed had not the Carthaginians been
afraid of the &#8220;crows,&#8221; and confined themselves to surrounding
and penning them in close to land, without attempting to
charge for fear of being caught by the grappling-irons. The
Consuls came up rapidly, and surrounding the Carthaginians
captured fifty of their ships with their crews, while some few
of them managed to slip away and escape by keeping close
to the shore.</p>

<p>Such was the result of the separate engagements. But the
general upshot of the whole battle was in favour
of the Romans. <span class="sidenote">General result.</span>Twenty-four of their vessels were
destroyed; over thirty of the Carthaginians. Not a single
Roman ship was captured with its crew; sixty-four of the
Carthaginians were so taken.</p>

<p><a name="b1_29" id="b1_29"><b>29.</b></a> After the battle the Romans took in a fresh supply of
victual, repaired and refitted the ships they had captured,
bestowed upon the crews the attention which they had
deserved by their victory, and then put to sea with a view
of continuing their voyage to Libya. Their leading ships made
the shore just under the headland called the Hermaeum, which
is the extreme point on the east of the Gulf of Carthage, and
runs out into the open sea in the direction of Sicily. There
they waited for the rest of the ships to come up, and having
got the entire fleet together coasted along until
they came to the city called Aspis. <span class="sidenote">Siege of Aspis. (Clupea.)</span> Here they
disembarked, beached their ships, dug a trench,
and constructed a stockade round them; and on the inhabitants
of the city refusing to submit without compulsion,
they set to work to besiege the town. Presently those of the
Carthaginians who had survived the sea-fight came to land
also; and feeling sure that the enemy, in the flush of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
victory, intended to sail straight against Carthage itself, they
began by keeping a chain of advanced guards at outlying
points to protect the capital with their military and naval
forces. But when they ascertained that the Romans had
disembarked without resistance and were engaged in besieging
Aspis, they gave up the idea of watching for the
descent of the fleet; but concentrated their forces, and devoted
themselves to the protection of the capital and its
environs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Romans had taken Aspis, had placed in it a
garrison to hold it and its territory, and had
besides sent home to Rome to announce the <span class="sidenote">Aspis taken.</span>
events which had taken place and to ask for instructions as
to the future,&mdash;what they were to do, and what arrangements
they were to make. Having done this they made active
preparations for a general advance and set about plundering
the country. They met with no opposition in this: they
destroyed numerous dwelling houses of remarkably fine construction,
possessed themselves of a great number of cattle;
and captured more than twenty thousand slaves whom they
took to their ships. In the midst of these proceedings the
messengers arrived from Rome with orders that one Consul
was to remain with an adequate force, the other was to bring
the fleet to Rome. Accordingly Marcus was <span class="sidenote">M. Atilius Regulus
remains in
Africa, winter of
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;256-255.</span>
left behind with forty ships, fifteen thousand
infantry, and five hundred cavalry; while
Lucius put the crowd of captives on board, and
having embarked his men, sailed along the coast of Sicily
without encountering any danger, and reached Rome.</p>

<p><a name="b1_30" id="b1_30"><b>30.</b></a> The Carthaginians now saw that their enemies contemplated
a lengthened occupation of the country. They
therefore proceeded first of all to elect two of their own
citizens, Hasdrubal son of Hanno, and Bostarus, to the office
of general; and next sent to Heracleia a pressing summons to
Hamilcar. He obeyed immediately, and arrived at Carthage
with five hundred cavalry and five thousand infantry. He was
forthwith appointed general in conjunction with the other two,
and entered into consultation with Hasdrubal and his colleague
as to the measures necessary to be taken in the present crisis.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
They decided to defend the country and not to allow it to be
devastated without resistance.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards Marcus sallied forth on one of his
marauding expeditions. Such towns as were
unwalled he carried by assault and plundered, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;256-255.
The operations of
Regulus in Libya.</span>
and such as were walled he besieged. Among
others he came to the considerable town of Adys, and having
placed his troops round it was beginning with all speed to raise
siege works. The Carthaginians were both eager to relieve
the town and determined to dispute the possession of the open
country. They therefore led out their army; but their operations
were not skilfully conducted. They indeed seized and
encamped upon a piece of rising ground which commanded
the enemy; but it was unsuitable to themselves. Their best
hopes rested on their cavalry and their elephants, and yet they
abandoned the level plain and cooped themselves up in a position
at once steep and difficult of access. The enemy, as might
have been expected, were not slow to take advantage of this
mistake. The Roman commanders were skilful enough to
understand that the best and most formidable part of the forces
opposed to them was rendered useless by the nature of the
ground. They did not therefore wait for them to come down
to the plain and offer battle, but choosing the time which
suited themselves, began at daybreak a forward movement on
both sides of the hill. <span class="sidenote">Defeat of the
Carthaginians
near Adys.</span>
In the battle which
followed the Carthaginians could not use their
cavalry or elephants at all; but their mercenary
troops made a really gallant and spirited sally. They even
forced the first division of the Romans to give way and fly:
but they advanced too far, and were surrounded and routed by
the division which was advancing from the other direction.
This was immediately followed by the whole force being
dislodged from their encampment. The elephants and cavalry
as soon as they gained level ground made good their retreat
without loss; but the infantry were pursued by the Romans.
The latter however soon desisted from the pursuit. They
presently returned, dismantled the enemy&#8217;s entrenchment, and
destroyed the stockade; and from thenceforth overran the
whole country-side and sacked the towns without opposition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>Among others they seized the town called Tunes. This place
had many natural advantages for expeditions
such as those in which they were engaged, <span class="sidenote">Tunes.</span>
and
was so situated as to form a convenient base of operations
against the capital and its immediate neighbourhood. They
accordingly fixed their headquarters in it.</p>

<p><a name="b1_31" id="b1_31"><b>31.</b></a> The Carthaginians were now indeed in evil case. It
was not long since they had sustained a disaster
at sea: and now they had met with one on land, <span class="sidenote">Distress at
Carthage, which
is heightened by
an inroad of

not from any failure of courage on the part of
their soldiers, but from the incompetency of their
commanders. Simultaneously with these misfortunes,
they were suffering from an inroad of the Numidians,
who were doing even more damage to the country than the
Romans. The terror which they inspired drove the country
folk to flock for safety into the city; and the city itself had to
face a serious famine as well as a panic, the former from the
numbers that crowded into it, the latter from the hourly
expectation of a siege. <span class="sidenote">Spring of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;255.
Regulus proposes
harsh terms.</span>
But Regulus had
different views. The double defeat sustained
by the Carthaginians, by land as well as by sea,
convinced him that the capture of Carthage was a question of
a very short time; and he was in a state of great anxiety lest
his successor in the Consulship should arrive from Rome in
time to rob him of the glory of the achievement. He therefore
invited the Carthaginians to make terms. They were
only too glad of the proposal, and sent their leading citizens
to meet him. The meeting took place: but the commissioners
could not bring their minds to entertain his proposals; they
were so severe that it was almost more than they could bear to
listen to them at all. Regulus regarded himself as practically
master of the city, and considered that they ought to regard
any concession on his part as a matter of favour and pure
grace. <span class="sidenote">The terms
rejected.</span>
The Carthaginians on the other hand
concluded that nothing worse could be imposed
on them if they suffered capture than was
now enjoined. They therefore returned home without
accepting the offers of Regulus, and extremely exasperated by
his unreasonable harshness. When the Carthaginian Senate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
heard the conditions offered by the Roman general, though
they had almost relinquished every hope of safety, they came
to the gallant and noble resolution that they would brave
anything, that they would try every possible means and endure
every extremity, rather than submit to terms so dishonourable
and so unworthy of their past history.</p>

<p><a name="b1_32" id="b1_32"><b>32.</b></a> Now it happened that just about this time one of their
recruiting agents, who had some time before
been despatched to Greece, arrived home. <span class="sidenote">Arrival of the
Spartan Xanthippus
in Carthage.</span>He
brought a large number of men with him, and
among them a certain Lacedaemonian named Xanthippus, a
man trained in the Spartan discipline, and of large experience
in war. When this man was informed of their defeat, and of
how it had taken place, and when he had reviewed the military
resources still left to the Carthaginians, and the number of
their cavalry and elephants, he did not take long to come to
a decided conclusion. He expressed his opinion to his friends
that the Carthaginians had owed their defeat, not to the
superiority of the Romans, but to the unskilfulness of their
own commanders. The dangerous state of their affairs caused
the words of Xanthippus to get abroad quickly among the
people and to reach the ears of the generals; and the men in
authority determined to summon and question him. He
appeared, and laid his views before the magistrates; in which
he showed to what they owed their present disasters, and that
if they would take his advice and keep to the flat parts of the
country alike in marching, encamping, and giving battle, they
would be able with perfect ease to secure safety for themselves
and to defeat their opponents in the field. The generals
accepted the suggestion, resolved to follow his advice, and
there and then put their forces at his command. Among the
multitude the observation of Xanthippus was passed from
mouth to mouth, and gave rise, as was to be expected, to
a good deal of popular rumour and sanguine talk. This
was confirmed when he had once handled the troops. The
way in which he got them into order when he had led them
outside the town; the skill with which he man&oelig;uvred the
separate detachments, and passed the word of command
down the ranks in due conformity to the rules of tactics, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
once impressed every one with the contrast to the blundering
of their former generals. The multitude expressed their
approbation by loud cheers, and were for engaging the enemy
without delay, convinced that no harm could happen to them
as long as Xanthippus was their leader. The generals took
advantage of this circumstance, and of the extraordinary
recovery which they saw had taken place in the spirits of
the people. They addressed them some exhortations befitting
the occasion, and after a few days&#8217; delay got their
forces on foot and started. Their army consisted of twelve
thousand infantry, four thousand cavalry, and nearly a hundred
elephants.</p>

<p><a name="b1_33" id="b1_33"><b>33.</b></a> The Romans at once noticed a change. They saw
that the Carthaginians chose level country for
their line of march, <span class="sidenote">The new strategy
of the Carthaginians.</span>
and flat places for their
encampments. This novelty puzzled and rather
alarmed them, yet their prevailing feeling was an eager desire
to come to close quarters with the enemy. They therefore
advanced to a position about ten stades from them and employed
the first day in pitching a camp there. Next day,
while the chief officers of the Carthaginians were discussing
in a council of war what dispositions were called for, and
what line of strategy they were to adopt, the common soldiers,
in their eagerness for the engagement, collected in groups,
shouted out the name of Xanthippus, and showed that their
opinion was in favour of an immediate forward movement.
Influenced by the evident enthusiasm and eagerness of the
army, and by the appeals of Xanthippus that they should not
let the opportunity slip, the generals gave orders to the men
to get ready, and resigned to Xanthippus the entire direction
of affairs, with full authority to act as he thought most advantageous.
He at once acted upon this authority. <span class="sidenote">The dispositions
for the battle.</span>
He ordered out the elephants, and placed them
in a single line in front of the whole army.
The heavy phalanx of the Carthaginians he stationed at a
moderate interval in the rear of these. He divided the
mercenaries into three corps. One he stationed on the right
wing; while the other two, which consisted of the most active,
he placed with the cavalry on both wings. When the Romans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
saw that the enemy were drawn up to offer them battle
they readily advanced to accept it. They were however
alarmed at the elephants, and made special arrangements
with a view to resist their charge. They stationed the velites
in the van, and behind them the legionaries, many maniples
deep, while they divided the cavalry between the two wings.
Their line of battle was thus less extended than usual, but
deeper. And though they had thereby made a sufficient provision
against the elephants, yet being far out-numbered in
cavalry, their provision in that part of the field was altogether
inadequate. At length both sides had made their dispositions
according to their respective plans of operation, and had placed
their several men in the posts assigned to them: and now they
were standing drawn up in order, and were each of them
watching for the right moment for beginning the attack.</p>

<p><a name="b1_34" id="b1_34"><b>34.</b></a> No sooner had Xanthippus given the order to the
men on the elephants to advance and disperse <span class="sidenote">The battle.</span>
the lines in front of them, and to his cavalry to
outflank both wings and charge the enemy, than the Roman
army&mdash;clashing their shields and spears together after their
usual custom, and simultaneously raising their battle-cry&mdash;charged
the enemy. The Roman cavalry being far out-numbered
by the Carthaginians were soon in full retreat on
both wings. But the fortune of the several divisions of the
infantry was various. Those stationed on the left wing&mdash;partly
because they could avoid the elephants and partly
because they thought contemptuously of the mercenaries&mdash;charged
the right wing of the Carthaginians, succeeded in
driving them from their ground, and pursued them as far as
their entrenchment. Those stationed in front of the elephants
were less fortunate. The maniples in front were thrown
into utter confusion by the crushing weight of the animals:
knocked down and trampled upon by them they perished in
heaps upon the field; yet owing to its great depth the main
body remained for a time unbroken. <span class="sidenote">The Romans are
beaten and
annihilated.</span>
But it
was not for long. The maniples on the rear
found themselves outflanked by the cavalry,
and were forced to face round and resist them: those on the
other hand who forced their way to the front through the elephants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and had now those beasts on their rear, found themselves
confronted by the phalanx of Carthaginians, which
had not yet been in action and was still in close unbroken
order, and so were cut to pieces. This was followed by a
general rout. Most of the Romans were trampled to death
by the enormous weight of the elephants; the rest were
shot down in their ranks by the numerous cavalry: and
there were only a very few who attempted to save themselves
by flight. But the flatness of the country was unfavourable
to escape in this manner. Some of the fugitives were
destroyed by the elephants and cavalry; <span class="sidenote">Regulus made
prisoner.</span>
while only those who
fled with the general Regulus, amounting perhaps
to five hundred, were after a short pursuit
made prisoners with him to a man.</p>

<p>On the Carthaginian side there fell about eight hundred of
the mercenaries, those namely who had been stationed opposite
the left wing of the Romans. On the part of the Romans
about two thousand survived. These were those whom I have
already described as having chased the Carthaginian right wing
to their entrenchment, and who were thus not involved in the
general engagement. The rest were entirely destroyed with
the exception of those who fled with Regulus. The surviving
maniples escaped with considerable difficulty to the town of
Aspis. The Carthaginians stripped the dead, and taking with
them the Roman general and the rest of their prisoners,
returned to the capital in a high state of exultation at the turn
their affairs had now taken.</p>

<p><a name="b1_35" id="b1_35"><b>35.</b></a> This event conveys many useful lessons to a thoughtful
observer. Above all, the disaster of Regulus gives the
clearest possible warning that no one should feel too confident
of the favours of Fortune, especially in the hour of success.
<span class="sidenote">Eurip. fr.</span>Here we see one, who a short time before refused all pity

<p>For it was one man, one brain, that defeated the numbers
which were believed to be invincible and able to accomplish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
anything; and restored to confidence a whole city that was
unmistakably and utterly ruined, and the spirits of its army
which had sunk to the lowest depths of despair. I record these
things in the hope of benefiting my readers. There are two
roads to reformation for mankind&mdash;one through misfortunes of
their own, the other through those of others: the former is the
most unmistakable, the latter the less painful. One should
never therefore voluntarily choose the former, for it makes reformation
a matter of great difficulty and danger; but we
should always look out for the latter, for thereby we can
without hurt to ourselves gain a clear view of the best course
to pursue. It is this which forces us to consider that the
knowledge gained from the study of true history is the best of
all educations for practical life. For it is history, and history
alone, which, without involving us in actual danger, will mature
our judgment and prepare us to take right views, whatever may
be the crisis or the posture of affairs.</p>

<p><a name="b1_36" id="b1_36"><b>36.</b></a> To return to our narrative. Having obtained this
complete success the Carthaginians indulged
in every sign of exultation. <span class="sidenote">Xanthippus quits
Carthage.</span>
Thanksgivings
were poured out to God, and joyful congratulations
interchanged among themselves. But Xanthippus, by
whose means such a happy change had been brought about
and such an impulse been given to the fortunes of Carthage,
did not remain there long, but took ship for home again. In
this he showed his wisdom and discernment. For it is the
nature of extraordinary and conspicuous achievements to exasperate
jealousies and envenom slander; against which a native
may perhaps stand with the support of kinsfolk and friends,
but a foreigner when exposed to one or the other of them is
inevitably overpowered before long and put in danger. There
is however another account sometimes given of the departure
of Xanthippus, which I will endeavour at a more suitable
opportunity to set forth.</p>

<p>Upon this unlooked-for catastrophe in the Libyan campaign,
the Roman government at once set to <span class="sidenote">The Romans
prepare a fleet to
relieve their
beaten army.</span>
work to fit out a fleet to take off the men who
were still surviving there; while the Carthaginians
followed up their success by sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
down before Aspis, and besieging it, being anxious to get the
survivors of the battle into their hands. But failing to capture
the place, owing to the gallantry and determined courage
of these men, they eventually raised the siege. When they
heard that the Romans were preparing their fleet, and were
intending to sail once more against Libya, they set about
shipbuilding also, partly repairing old vessels and partly constructing
new. Before very long they had manned and
launched two hundred ships, and were on the watch for the
coming of their enemies. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;255.
Coss. Ser. Fulvius
Paetinus
Nobilior, M.
Aemilius Paullus.</span>
By the beginning of
the summer the Romans had launched three
hundred and fifty vessels. They put them
under the command of the Consuls Marcus
Aemilius and Servius Fulvius, and despatched
them. This fleet coasted along Sicily; made for Libya;
and having fallen in with the Carthaginian squadron off Hermaeum,
at once charged and easily turned them to flight;
captured a hundred and fourteen with their crews, and having
taken on board their men who had maintained themselves
in Libya, started from Aspis on their return voyage
to Sicily.</p>

<p><a name="b1_37" id="b1_37"><b>37.</b></a> The passage was effected in safety, and the coast of
Camarina was reached: but there they experienced so terrible
a storm, and suffered so dreadfully, as almost to
beggar description. <span class="sidenote">The fleet is lost
in a storm.</span>
The disaster was indeed
extreme: for out of their three hundred and
sixty-four vessels eighty only remained. The rest were either
swamped or driven by the surf upon the rocks and headlands,
where they went to pieces and filled all the seaboard with
corpses and wreckage. No greater catastrophe is to be found
in all history as befalling a fleet at one time. And for this
Fortune was not so much to blame as the commanders themselves.
They had been warned again and again by the pilots
not to steer along the southern coast of Sicily facing the
Libyan sea, because it was exposed and yielded no safe anchorage;
and because, of the two dangerous constellations, <span class="sidenote">Between June 28
and July 26.</span>
one had
not yet set and the other was on the point of
rising (for their voyage fell between the rising of
Orion and that of the Dog Star). Yet they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
attended to none of these warnings; but, intoxicated by their
recent success, were anxious to capture certain cities as they
coasted along, and in pursuance of this idea thoughtlessly exposed
themselves to the full fury of the open sea. As far as these
particular men were concerned, the disaster which they brought
upon themselves in the pursuit of trivial advantages convinced
them of the folly of their conduct. But it is a peculiarity of
the Roman people as a whole to treat everything as a question
of main strength; to consider that they must of course accomplish
whatever they have proposed to themselves; and that
nothing is impossible that they have once determined upon.
The result of such self-confidence is that in many things they
do succeed, while in some few they conspicuously fail, and
especially at sea. On land it is against men only and their
works that they have to direct their efforts: and as the forces
against which they exert their strength do not differ intrinsically
from their own, as a general rule they succeed; while
their failures are exceptional and rare. But to contend with the
sea and sky is to fight against a force immeasurably superior to
their own: and when they trust to an exertion of sheer strength
in such a contest the disasters which they meet with are signal.
This is what they experienced on the present occasion: they
have often experienced it since; and will continue to do so,
as long as they maintain their headstrong and foolhardy notion
that any season of the year admits of sailing as well as
marching.</p>

<p><a name="b1_38" id="b1_38"><b>38.</b></a> When the Carthaginians heard of the destruction which
had befallen the Roman fleet, they made up their minds that
as their late victory had made them a match for their enemy
on land, so now the Roman catastrophe had made them a
match for him at sea. Accordingly they devoted themselves
with still greater eagerness than before to their naval and military
preparations. <span class="sidenote">The
Carthaginians
renew operations
in Sicily.</span>
And first, they lost no time in
despatching Hasdrubal to Sicily, and with him
not only the soldiers that they had already collected,
but those also whom they had recalled
from Heracleia; and along with them they sent also a hundred
and forty elephants. And next, after despatching him, they
began fitting out two hundred ships and making all other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
preparations necessary for a naval expedition. Hasdrubal
reached Lilybaeum safely, and immediately set to work to
train his elephants and drill his men, and showed his intention
of striking a blow for the possession of the open
country.</p>

<p>The Roman government, when they heard of this from the
survivors of the wreck on their arrival home, felt it to be a
grievous misfortune; but being absolutely resolved not to give
in, they determined once more to put two hundred and twenty
vessels on the stocks and build afresh. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;254.
Coss. Gn. Cornelius
Scipio Asina II.,
Aulus Atilius,

These
were finished in three months, an almost incredibly
short time, and the new Consuls Aulus
Atilius and Gnaeus Cornelius fitted out the
fleet and put to sea. As they passed through
the straits they took up from Messene those of the vessels
which had been saved from the wreck; and having thus arrived
with three hundred ships off Panormus, which is the
strongest town of all the Carthaginian province in Sicily, they
began to besiege it. They threw up works in two distinct
places, and after other necessary preparations brought up their
battering rams. The tower next the sea was destroyed with
ease, and the soldiers forced their way in through the breach:
and so what is called the New Town was carried by assault;
while what is called the Old Town being placed by this event
in imminent danger, its inhabitants made haste to surrender
it. Having thus made themselves masters of the place,
the army sailed back to Rome, leaving a garrison in the
town.</p>

<p><a name="b1_39" id="b1_39"><b>39.</b></a> But next summer the new Consuls Gnaeus Servilius
and Gaius Sempronius put again to sea with
their full strength, and after touching at Sicily
started thence for Libya. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;253.
Coss. Gn.
Servilius Caepio,

Blaesus.</span>
There, as they coasted
along the shore, they made a great number of
descents upon the country without accomplishing
anything of importance in any of them. At length they
came to the island of the Lotophagi called M&#275;nix, which is
not far from the Lesser Syrtis. There, from ignorance of the
waters, they ran upon some shallows; the tide receded, their
ships went aground, and they were in extreme peril. However,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
after a while the tide unexpectedly flowed back again, and by
dint of throwing overboard all their heavy goods they just
managed to float the ships. After this their return voyage was
more like a flight than anything else. When they reached
Sicily and had made the promontory of Lilybaeum they cast
anchor at Panormus. Thence they weighed anchor for Rome,
and rashly ventured upon the open sea-line as the shortest;
but while on their voyage they once more encountered so
terrible a storm that they lost more than a hundred and
fifty ships.</p>

<p>The Romans after this misfortune, though they are eminently
persistent in carrying out their undertakings, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;252.</span>
yet owing to the severity and frequency
of their disasters, now yielded to the force of circumstances
and refrained from constructing another fleet. All the hopes
still left to them they rested upon their land
forces: and, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;251.
Coss. Lucius
Caecilius
Metellus, G.
Furius Pacilus.</span>
accordingly, they despatched the
Consuls Lucius Caecilius and Gaius Furius with
their legions to Sicily; but they only manned
sixty ships to carry provisions for the legions.
The fortunes of the Carthaginians had in their turn considerably
improved owing to the catastrophes I have described.
They now commanded the sea without let or hindrance,
since the Romans had abandoned it; while in their land
forces their hopes were high. Nor was it unreasonable
that it should be so. The account of the battle of Libya
had reached the ears of the Romans: they had heard that
the elephants had broken their ranks and had killed the large
part of those that fell: and they were in such terror of them,
that though during two years running after that time they
had on many occasions, in the territory either of Lilybaeum or
Selinus, found themselves in order of battle within five or six
stades of the enemy, they never plucked up courage to begin
an attack, or in fact to come down upon level ground at all,
all because of their fear of an elephant charge. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;252-251.</span>
And in these two seasons all they did was to
reduce Therma and Lipara by siege, keeping close all the
while to mountainous districts and such as were difficult to
cross. The timidity and want of confidence thus displayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
by their land forces induced the Roman government to
change their minds and once more to attempt
success at sea. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;250.</span>Accordingly, in the second consulship
of Caius Atilius and Lucius Manlius, we find them
ordering fifty ships to be built, enrolling sailors and energetically
collecting a naval armament.</p>

<p><a name="b1_40" id="b1_40"><b>40.</b></a> Meanwhile Hasdrubal noticed the terror displayed by
the Romans whenever they had lately found
themselves in the presence of the enemy. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;251.</span>He
learnt also that one of the Consuls had departed and gone
to Italy, and that Caecilius was lingering in Panormus with
the other half of the army, <span class="sidenote">Skirmishing
at Panormus.</span>with the view of
protecting the corn-crops of the allies just
then ripe for the harvest. He therefore got
his troops in motion, marched out, and encamped on the
frontier of the territory of Panormus. Caecilius saw well
enough that the enemy had become supremely confident, and
he was anxious to draw him on; he therefore kept his men
within the walls. Hasdrubal imagined that Caecilius dared
not come out to give him battle. Elated with this idea, he
pushed boldly forward with his whole army and marched over
the pass into the territory of Panormus. But though he was
destroying all the standing crops up to the very walls of the
town, Caecilius was not shaken from his resolution, but kept
persistently to it, until he had induced him to cross the river
which lay between him and the town. But no sooner had the
Carthaginians got their elephants and men across, than
Caecilius commenced sending out his light-armed troops to
harass them, until he had forced them to get their whole army
into fighting order. When he saw that everything was happening
as he designed it, he placed some of his light troops to
line the wall and moat, with instructions that if the elephants
came within range they should pour volleys of their missiles
upon them; but that whenever they found themselves being
forced from their ground by them, they should retreat into the
moat, rush out of it again, and hurl darts at the elephants
which happened to be nearest. At the same time he gave
orders to the armourers in the market-place to carry the
missiles and heap them up outside at the foot of the wall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Meanwhile he took up his own position with his maniples at
the gate which was opposite the enemy&#8217;s left wing, and kept
despatching detachment after detachment to reinforce his
skirmishers. The engagement commenced by them becoming
more and more general, a feeling of emulation took possession
of the officers in charge of the elephants. They wished
to distinguish themselves in the eyes of Hasdrubal, and
they desired that the credit of the victory should be theirs:
they therefore, with one accord, charged the advanced skirmishing
parties of the enemy, routed them with ease, and
pursued them up to the moat. But no sooner did the elephants
thus come to close quarters than they were wounded by
the archers on the wall, and overwhelmed with volleys of pila
and javelins which poured thick and fast upon them from the
men stationed on the outer edge of the moat, and who had
not yet been engaged,&mdash;and thus, studded all over with darts,
and wounded past all bearing, they soon got beyond control.
They turned and bore down upon their own masters, trampling
men to death, and throwing their own lines into utter disorder
and confusion. When Caecilius saw this he led out his men
with promptitude. His troops were fresh; the enemy were in
disorder; and he charged them diagonally on the flank: the
result was that he inflicted a severe defeat upon them, killed a
large number, and forced the rest into precipitate flight. Of the
elephants he captured ten along with their Indian riders: the
rest which had thrown their Indians he managed to drive into
a herd after the battle, and secured every one of them. This
achievement gained him the credit on all hands of having substantially
benefited the Roman cause, by once more restoring
confidence to the army, and giving them the command of the
open country.</p>

<p><a name="b1_41" id="b1_41"><b>41.</b></a> The announcement of this success at Rome was received
with extreme delight; not so much at the blow inflicted
on the enemy by the loss of their elephants, as at the confidence
inspired in their own troops by a victory over these animals. With
their confidence thus restored, the Roman government recurred
to their original plan of sending out the Consuls upon this service
with a fleet and naval forces; for they were eager, by all means
in their power, to put a period to the war. Accordingly, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the fourteenth year of the war, the supplies necessary for
the despatch of the expedition were got ready, and the Consuls
set sail for Sicily with two hundred ships. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;250.
C. Caecilius Regulus II.,
L. Manlius Vulso II.</span>
They dropped anchor at Lilybaeum; and the
army having met them there, they began to
besiege it by sea and land. Their view was
that if they could obtain possession of this
town they would have no difficulty in transferring the seat
of war to Libya. The Carthaginian leaders were of the same
opinion, and entirely agreed with the Roman view of the value
of the place. They accordingly subordinated everything else
to this; devoted themselves to the relief of the place at all
hazards; and resolved to retain this town at any sacrifice: for
now that the Romans were masters of all the rest of Sicily,
except Drepana, it was the only foothold they had left in the
island.</p>

<p>To understand my story a knowledge of the topography of
the district is necessary. I will therefore endeavour in a few
words to convey a comprehension to my readers of its
geographical position and its peculiar advantages.</p>

<p><a name="b1_42" id="b1_42"><b>42.</b></a> Sicily, then, lies towards Southern Italy very much in
the same relative position as the Peloponnese does to the rest
of Greece. The only difference is that the one is an island,
the other a peninsula; and consequently in the former case
there is no communication except by sea, in the latter there is
a land communication also. The shape of Sicily is a triangle,
of which the several angles are represented by promontories:
that to the south jutting out into the Sicilian Sea is called
Pachynus; that which looks to the north forms the western
extremity of the Straits of Messene and is about twelve
stades from Italy, its name is Pelorus; while the third
projects in the direction of Libya itself, and is conveniently
situated opposite the promontories which cover Carthage, at a
distance of about a thousand stades: it looks somewhat south
of due west, dividing the Libyan from the Sardinian Sea, and
is called Lilybaeum. On this last there is a city of the same
name. It was this city that the Romans were now besieging.
It was exceedingly strongly fortified: for besides its walls there
was a deep ditch running all round it, and on the side of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
sea it was protected by lagoons, to steer through which into
the harbour was a task requiring much skill and practice.</p>

<p>The Romans made two camps, one on each side of the
town, and connected them with a ditch, <span class="sidenote">Siege of
Lilybaeum,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;250.</span>
stockade, and wall. Having done this, they
began the assault by advancing their siege-works
in the direction of the tower nearest the sea, which commands
a view of the Libyan main. They did this gradually, always
adding something to what they had already constructed; and
thus bit by bit pushed their works forward and extended them
laterally, till at last they had brought down not only this tower,
but the six next to it also; and at the same time began battering
all the others with battering-rams. The siege was carried
on with vigour and terrific energy: every day some of the
towers were shaken and others reduced to ruins; every
day too the siege-works advanced farther and farther, and
more and more towards the heart of the city. And though
there were in the town, besides the ordinary inhabitants, as
many as ten thousand hired soldiers, the consternation and
despondency became overwhelming. Yet their commander
Himilco omitted no measure within his power. As fast
as the enemy demolished a fortification he threw up a new
one; he also countermined them, and reduced the assailants
to straits of no ordinary difficulty. Moreover, he made
daily sallies, attempted to carry or throw fire into the siege-works,
and with this end in view fought many desperate
engagements by night as well as by day: so determined was
the fighting in these struggles, that sometimes the number of
the dead was greater than it ordinarily is in a pitched battle.</p>

<p><a name="b1_43" id="b1_43"><b>43.</b></a> But about this time some of the officers of highest
rank in the mercenary army discussed among <span class="sidenote">Attempted
treason in
Lilybaeum.</span>
themselves a project for surrendering the town
to the Romans, being fully persuaded that the
men under their command would obey their orders. They
got out of the city at night, went to the enemy&#8217;s camp, and
held a parley with the Roman commander on the subject.
But Alexon the Achaean, who on a former occasion had saved
Agrigentum from destruction when the mercenary troops of
Syracuse made a plot to betray it, was on this occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
once more the first to detect this treason, and to report it to the
general of the Carthaginians. The latter no sooner heard it
than he at once summoned a meeting of those officers who
were still in their quarters; and exhorted them to loyalty with
prayers and promises of liberal bounties and favours, if they
would only remain faithful to him, and not join in the treason
of the officers who had left the town. They received his
speech with enthusiasm, and were there and then commissioned
by him, some to go to the Celts accompanied by Hannibal,
who was the son of the Hannibal killed in Sardinia, and who
had a previous acquaintance with that people gained in the
expedition against them; others to fetch the rest of the
mercenary troops, accompanied by Alexon, because he was
liked and trusted by them. These officers then proceeded to
summon a meeting of their men and address them. They
pledged their own credit for the bounties promised them
severally by the General, and without difficulty persuaded the
men to remain staunch. The result was that when the
officers, who had joined in the secret mission, returned to the
walls and tried to address their men, and communicate the
terms offered by the Romans, so far from finding any adherents,
they could not even obtain a hearing, but were driven from
the wall with volleys of stones and darts. But this treason
among their mercenaries constituted a serious danger: the
Carthaginians had a narrow escape from absolute ruin, and
they owed their preservation from it to that same Alexon whose
fidelity had on a former occasion preserved for Agrigentum
her territory, constitution, and freedom.</p>

<p><a name="b1_44" id="b1_44"><b>44.</b></a> Meanwhile the Carthaginians at home knew nothing of
what was going on. But they could calculate
the requirements of a besieged garrison; <span class="sidenote">Hannibal relieves
Lilybaeum.</span>
and
they accordingly filled fifty vessels with soldiers,
furnished their commander Hannibal, a son of Hamilcar, and
an officer and prime favourite of Adherbal&#8217;s, with instructions
suitable to the business in hand, and despatched him with all
speed: charging him to be guilty of no delay, to omit no
opportunity, and to shrink from no attempt however venturesome
to relieve the besieged. He put to sea with his ten
thousand men, and dropped anchor at the islands called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Aegusae, which lie in the course between Lilybaeum and
Carthage, and there looked out for an opportunity of making
Lilybaeum. At last a strong breeze sprang up in exactly the
right quarter: he crowded all sail and bore down before the
wind right upon the entrance of the harbour, with his men
upon the decks fully armed and ready for battle. Partly from
astonishment at this sudden appearance, partly from dread of
being carried along with the enemy by the violence of the
gale into the harbour of their opponents, the Romans did not
venture to obstruct the entrance of the reinforcement; but
stood out at sea overpowered with amazement at the audacity
of the enemy.</p>

<p>The town population crowded to the walls, in an agony of
anxiety as to what would happen, no less than in an excess of
joy at the unlooked-for appearance of hope, and cheered on the
crews as they sailed into the harbour, with clapping hands
and cries of gladness. To sail into the harbour was an
achievement of great danger; but Hannibal accomplished it
gallantly, and, dropping anchor there, safely disembarked his
soldiers. The exultation of all who were in the city was not
caused so much by the presence of the reinforcement, though
they had thereby gained a strong revival of hope, and a large
addition to their strength, as by the fact that the Romans had
not dared to intercept the course of the Carthaginians.</p>

<p><a name="b1_45" id="b1_45"><b>45.</b></a> Himilco, the general in command at Lilybaeum, now

garrison owing to the presence of the reinforcement,
the newly arrived because they had as yet had no experience
of the hardships of the situation. He wished to take
advantage of the excited feelings of both parties, before they
cooled, in order to organise an attempt to set fire to the works of
the besiegers. He therefore summoned the whole army to a
meeting, and dwelt upon the themes suitable to the occasion
at somewhat greater length than usual. He raised their zeal
to an enthusiastic height by the magnitude of his promises for
individual acts of courage, and by declaring the favours and
rewards which awaited them as an army at the hands of the
Carthaginians. His speech was received with lively marks of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
satisfaction; and the men with loud shouts bade him delay no
more, but lead them into the field. For the present, however,
he contented himself with thanking them and expressing his
delight at their excellent spirit, and bidding them go early to
rest and obey their officers, dismissed them. But shortly
afterwards he summoned the officers; assigned to them severally
the posts best calculated for the success of the undertaking;
communicated to them the watchword and the exact moment
the movement was to be made; and issued orders to the commanders
to be at the posts assigned with their men at the
morning watch. His orders were punctually obeyed: and at
daybreak he led out his forces and made attempts upon the
siege-works at several points. But the Romans had not been
blind to what was coming, and were neither idle nor unprepared.
Wherever help was required it was promptly rendered;
and at every point they made a stout resistance to the enemy.
Before long there was fighting all along the line, and an
obstinate struggle round the entire circuit of the wall; for the
sallying party were not less than twenty thousand strong, and
their opponents more numerous still. The contest was all
the hotter from the fact that the men were not fighting in
their regular ranks, but indiscriminately, and as their own
judgment directed; the result of which was that a spirit of
personal emulation arose among the combatants, because,
though the numbers engaged were so great, there was a series
of single combats between man and man, or company and
company. However, it was at the siege-works themselves that
the shouting was loudest and the throng of combatants the
densest. At these troops had been massed deliberately for
attack and defence. The assailants strove their utmost to
dislodge the defenders, the defenders exerted all their courage
to hold their ground and not yield an inch to the assailants,&mdash;and
with such emulation and fury on both sides, that they
ended by falling at their posts rather than yield. But there
were others mingled with these, carrying torchwood and tow
and fire, who made a simultaneous attack upon the battering-rams
at every point: hurling these fiery missiles against them
with such audacity, that the Romans were reduced to the last
extremity of danger, being quite unable to overpower the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
attack of the enemy. But the general of the Carthaginians,
seeing that he was losing large numbers in the
engagement, <span class="sidenote">It fails.</span>without being able to gain the
object of the sortie, which was to take the siege-works, ordered
his trumpeters to sound a recall. So the Romans, after
coming within an ace of losing all their siege-gear, finally kept
possession of the works, and were able to maintain them all
without dispute.</p>

<p><a name="b1_46" id="b1_46"><b>46.</b></a> After this affair Hannibal eluded the enemy&#8217;s watch,
and sailed out of the harbour by night with his ships to
Drepana, to join the Carthaginian Commander-in-Chief,
Adherbal. Drepana is about one hundred and twenty
stades from Lilybaeum, and was always an object of special
care to the Carthaginians from the convenience of its position
and the excellence of its harbour.</p>

<p>Now the Carthaginian government were anxious to learn
the state of affairs at Lilybaeum, but could not
do so because the garrison was strictly blockaded,
and the Romans were exceedingly vigilant. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal the Rhodian offers to run the blockade.</span>
In this difficulty a nobleman, called Hannibal
the Rhodian, came to them, and offered to run the
blockade, to see what was going on in Lilybaeum with his own
eyes, and to report. The offer delighted them, but they did
not believe in the possibility of its fulfilment with the Roman
fleet lying at the very entrance of the channel. However, the
man fitted out his own private vessel and put to sea. He
first crossed to one of the islands lying off Lilybaeum. Next
day he obtained a wind in the right quarter, and about ten
o&#8217;clock in the morning actually sailed into the harbour in the
full view of the enemy, who looked on with amazement at his
audacity. Next day he lost no time in setting about a return
voyage. The Roman Consul had determined on taking extra
precautions for watching the sea near the channel: with this
view he had during the night got ready his ten fastest-sailing
vessels, and taking up a position on shore close to the harbour
mouth, was watching with his own eyes what would happen.
The whole army was watching also; while the ships on both
sides of the mouth of the channel got as close to the shallows
as it was possible to approach, and there rested with their oars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
out, and ready to run down and capture the ship that was
about to sail out. The Rhodian, on his side, attempted no
concealment. He put boldly to sea, and so confounded the
enemy by his audacity, and the speed of his vessel, that he not
only sailed out without receiving any damage to ship or crew,
scudding along the bows of the enemy as though they were
fixed in their places, but even brought his ship to, after running
a short way ahead, and, with his oars out and ready,
seemed to challenge the foe to a contest. When none of them
ventured to put out to attack him, because of the speed of his
rowing, he sailed away: having thus with his one ship successfully
defied the entire fleet of the enemy. From this time he
frequently performed the same feat, and proved exceedingly
serviceable both to the government at Carthage and the
besieged garrison. To the former by informing them from
time to time of what was pressingly necessary; and to the latter
by inspiring them with confidence, and dismaying the Romans
by his audacity.</p>

<p><a name="b1_47" id="b1_47"><b>47.</b></a> What contributed most to encourage him to a repetition
of the feat was the fact that by frequent experience
he had marked out the course for himself by clear land
marks. As soon as he had crossed the open sea, and
was coming into sight, he used to steer as though he were
coming from Italy, keeping the seaward tower exactly on his
bows, in such a way as to be in a line with the city towers
which faced towards Libya; and this is the only possible
course to hit the mouth of the channel with the wind astern.
The successful boldness of the Rhodian inspired <span class="sidenote">His example is
followed by
others.</span>
several of those who were acquainted with these
waters to make similar attempts. The Romans
felt themselves to be in a great difficulty; and what was taking
place determined them to attempt blocking up the mouth of
the harbour. The greater part of the attempted work was a
failure: the sea was too deep, and none of the material which
they threw into it would hold, or in fact keep in the least
compact. The breakers and the force of the current dislodged
and scattered everything that was thrown in, before it could
even reach the bottom. But there was one point where the
water was shallow, at which a mole was with infinite labour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
made to hold together; and upon it a vessel with four banks
of oars and of unusually fine build stuck fast
as it was making the outward passage at night, <span class="sidenote">The Rhodian is
at length
captured.</span>
and thus fell into the hands of the enemy.
The Romans took possession of it, manned it with a picked
crew, and used it for keeping a look out for all who should
try to enter the harbour, and especially for the Rhodian. He
had sailed in, as it happened, that very night, and was afterwards
putting out to sea again in his usual open manner. He
was, however, startled to see the four-banked vessel put out
to sea again simultaneously with himself. He recognised
what ship it was, and his first impulse was to escape her by his
superior speed. But finding himself getting overhauled by
the excellence of her rowers, he was finally compelled to
bring to and engage at close quarters. But in a struggle of
marines he was at a complete disadvantage: the enemy were
superior in numbers, and their soldiers were picked men; and
he was made prisoner. The possession of this ship of superior
build enabled the Romans, by equipping her with whatever
was wanted for the service she had to perform, to intercept all
who were adventurous enough to try running the blockade of
Lilybaeum.</p>

<p><a name="b1_48" id="b1_48"><b>48.</b></a> Meanwhile, the besieged were energetically carrying
on counterworks, having abandoned the hope
of damaging or destroying the constructions of
the enemy. <span class="sidenote">A storm having
damaged the
siege-works, the
Lilybaeans succeed
in burning them.</span>
But in the midst of these proceedings
a storm of wind, of such tremendous
violence and fury, blew upon the machinery of
the engines, that it wrecked the pent-houses,
and carried away by its force the towers erected to cover
them. Some of the Greek mercenaries perceived the advantage
such a state of things offered for the destruction of the
siege-works, and communicated their idea to the commander.
He caught at the suggestion, and lost no time in making every
preparation suitable to the undertaking. Then the young men
mustered at three several points, and threw lighted brands into
the enemy&#8217;s works. The length of time during which these
works had been standing made them exactly in the proper state
to catch fire easily; and when to this was added a violent wind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
blowing right upon the engines and towers, the natural result
was that the spreading of the fire became rapid and destructive;
while all attempts on the Roman side to master it, and rescue
their works, had to be abandoned as difficult or wholly
impracticable. Those who tried to come to the rescue were
so appalled at the scene, that they could neither fully grasp
nor clearly see what was going on. Flames, sparks, and
volumes of smoke blew right in their faces and blinded them;
and not a few dropped down and perished without ever getting
near enough to attempt to combat the fire. The same
circumstances, which caused these overwhelming difficulties to
the besiegers, favoured those who were throwing the fire-brands
in exactly the same proportion. Everything that could obscure
their vision or hurt them was blown clean away and carried
into the faces of the enemy; while their being able to see the
intervening space enabled the shooters to take a good aim at
those of the enemy who came to the rescue, and the throwers
of the fire-brands to lodge them at the proper places for the
destruction of the works. The violence of the wind, too,
contributed to the deadly effect of the missiles by increasing
the force of their blows. Eventually the destruction was so
complete, that the foundations of the siege-towers and the
blocks of the battering-rams were rendered unusable by the
fire. In spite of this disaster, though they gave up the idea
of assaulting the place any longer by means of their works,
the Romans still persisted. They surrounded the town with
a ditch and stockade, threw up an additional wall to secure
their own encampment, and left the completion of their
purpose to time. Nor were the besieged less determined.
They repaired the part of their walls which had been thrown
down, and prepared to endure the siege with good courage.</p>

<p><a name="b1_49" id="b1_49"><b>49.</b></a> When the announcement of these events at Rome was
followed by reiterated tidings that the larger <span class="sidenote">The Roman army
is reinforced.</span>
part of the crews of the fleet had been destroyed,
either at the works, or in the general conduct of
the siege, the Roman government set zealously to work to
enlist sailors; and, having collected as many as ten thousand,
sent them to Sicily. They crossed the straits, and reached
the camp on foot; and when they had joined, Publius Claudius,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the Consul, assembled his tribunes, and said that it was just
the time to sail to the attack of Drepana with <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;249.
Coss. P. Claudius
Pulcher, L.
Junius Pullus.</span>
the whole squadron: for that Adherbal,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> who
was in command there, was quite unprepared
for such an event, because he as yet knew nothing
of the new crews having arrived; and was fully persuaded
that their fleet could not sail, owing to their loss of men in
the siege. His proposition met with a ready assent from the
council of officers, and he immediately set about getting his
men on board, the old crews as well as those who had recently
joined. As for marines, he selected the best men from the
whole army, who were ready enough to join an expedition
which involved so short a voyage and so immediate
and certain an advantage. Having <span class="sidenote">Claudius sails to
attack Drepana.</span>
completed these preparations, he set sail about
midnight, without being detected by the enemy; and for the
first part of the day he sailed in close order, keeping the
land on his right. By daybreak the leading ships could be
seen coming towards Drepana; and at the first sight of them
Adherbal was overwhelmed with surprise. He quickly recovered
his self-possession however: and, fully appreciating
the significance of the enemy&#8217;s attack, he determined to try
every man&oelig;uvre, and hazard every danger, rather than allow
himself and his men to be shut up in the blockade which
threatened them. He lost no time in collecting his rowing-crews
upon the beach, and summoning the mercenary soldiers
who were in the town by proclamation. When the muster
had taken place, he endeavoured to impress upon them in
a few words what good hopes of victory they had, if they
were bold enough to fight at sea; and what hardships they
would have to endure in a blockade, if they hesitated from
any fear of danger and played the coward. The men
showed a ready enthusiasm for the sea-fight, and demanded
with shouts that he would lead them to it without delay.
He thanked them, praised their zeal, and gave the order
to embark with all speed, to keep their eyes upon his ship,
and follow in its wake. Having made these instructions
clear as quickly as he could, he got under weigh himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>first, and guided his fleet close under the rocks, on the
opposite side of the harbour to that by which the enemy were
entering.</p>

<p><a name="b1_50" id="b1_50"><b>50.</b></a> When the Consul Publius saw, to his surprise, that the
enemy, so far from giving in or being
dismayed at his approach, <span class="sidenote">Unexpected resistance

fleet checked.</span>
were determined
upon fighting him at sea: while of his own ships
some were already within the harbour, others
just in the very entrance channel, and others still on their
way towards it; he at once issued orders to all the ships to
turn round and make the best of their way out again.
The result of this was that, as some of the ships were in the
harbour, and others at the entrance, they fouled each other
when they began reversing their course; and not only did a
great confusion arise among the men, but the ships got their
oars broken also in the collisions which occurred. However,
the captains exerted themselves to get the ships into line
close under the shore, as they successively cleared the harbour,
and with their prows directed towards the enemy. Publius
himself was originally bringing up the rear of the entire squadron;
but he now, while the movement was actually in execution,
turned towards the open sea and transferred himself to a position
on the left wing of the fleet. At the same moment Adherbal
succeeded in outflanking the left of his opponents with five vessels
furnished with charging beaks. He turned his own ship with
its prow towards the enemy, and brought to. As each of the
others came up, and fell into line with him, he sent orders to
them by his staff officers to do the same as he had done. Thus
they all fell in and formed a complete line. The signal which
had been agreed upon before was given, and an advance was begun,
which was made at first without disarranging the line. The
Romans were still close in-shore, waiting for the coming out of
their ships from the harbour; and this proximity to the land
proved of infinite disadvantage to them in the engagement.</p>

<p><a name="b1_51" id="b1_51"><b>51.</b></a> And now the fleets were within a short distance of each
other: the signals were raised from the ships <span class="sidenote">The battle.</span>
of the respective commanders; the charge was
made; and ship grappled with ship. At first the engagement
was evenly balanced, because each fleet had the pick of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
land forces serving as marines on board. But as it went on
the many advantages which, taking it as a whole, the Carthaginians
possessed, gave them a continually increasing superiority.
Owing to the better construction of their ships they
had much the advantage in point of speed, while their position
with the open sea behind them materially contributed to their
success, by giving them freer space for their man&oelig;uvres. Were
any of them hard pressed by the enemy? Their speed secured
them a sure escape, and a wide expanse of water was open to
their flight. There they would swing round and attack the leading
ships which were pursuing them: sometimes rowing round
them and charging their broadsides, at other times running
alongside them as they lurched awkwardly round, from the weight
of the vessels and the unskilfulness of the crews. In this way
they were charging perpetually, and managed to sink a large
number of the ships. Or was one of their number in danger?
They were ready to come to the rescue, being out of danger
themselves, and being able to effect a movement to right or
left, by steering along the sterns of their own ships and through
the open sea unmolested. <span class="sidenote">The Romans
beaten.</span>
The case of the
Romans was exactly the reverse. If any of
them were hard pressed, there was nowhere for
them to retreat, for they were fighting close to the shore; and
any ship of theirs that was hard driven by the enemy either
backed into shallow water and stuck fast, or ran ashore and
was stranded. Moreover, that most effective of all man&oelig;uvres
in sea fights,&mdash;sailing through the enemy&#8217;s line and appearing
on their stern while they are engaged with others,&mdash;was
rendered impossible for them, owing to the bulk of their
vessels; and still more so by the unskilfulness of their crews.
Nor, again, were they able to bring help from behind to those
who wanted it, because they were hemmed in so close to the
shore that there was not the smallest space left in which those
who wished to render such help might move. When the
Consul saw how ill things were going for him all along the
line; when he saw some of his ships sticking fast in the
shallows, and others cast ashore; he took to flight. Thirty
other ships which happened to be near him followed him as he
sailed from the left, and coasted along the shore. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
remaining vessels, which amounted to ninety-three, the Carthaginians
captured with their crews, except in the case of those
who ran their ships ashore and got away.</p>

<p><a name="b1_52" id="b1_52"><b>52.</b></a> The result of this sea fight gave Adherbal a high reputation
at Carthage; for his success was looked upon as wholly
due to himself, and his own foresight and courage: while
at Rome Publius fell into great disrepute, and was loudly censured
as having acted without due caution or calculation, and
as having during his administration, as far as a single man
could, involved Rome in serious disasters. He was accordingly
some time afterwards brought to trial, was heavily fined,
and exposed to considerable danger. Not that the Romans
gave way in consequence of these events. <span class="sidenote">The Romans not
discouraged send

Junius with a

provisions in 800

On the contrary,
they omitted nothing that was within their
power to do, and continued resolute to prosecute
the campaign. It was now the time for
the Consular elections: as soon as they were
over and two Consuls appointed; one of them,
Lucius Junius,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> was immediately sent to convey
corn to the besiegers of Lilybaeum, and other
provisions and supplies necessary for the army,
sixty ships being also manned to convoy them.
Upon his arrival at Messene, Junius took over such ships as he
found there to meet him, whether from the army or from the
other parts of Sicily, and coasted along with all speed to Syracuse,
with a hundred and twenty ships, and his supplies on
board about eight hundred transports. Arrived there, he
handed over to the Quaestors half his transports and some of
his war-ships, and sent them off, being very anxious that
what the army needed should reach them promptly. He remained
at Syracuse himself, waiting for such of his ships as
had not yet arrived from Messene, and collecting additional
supplies of corn from the allies in the central districts of the
island.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b1_53" id="b1_53"><b>53.</b></a> Meanwhile Adherbal sent the prisoners he had taken
in the sea fight, and the captured vessels, to Carthage; and
giving Carthalo his colleague thirty vessels, in addition to the
seventy in command of which he had come, despatched him
with instructions to make a sudden attack upon the enemy&#8217;s
ships that were at anchor off Lilybaeum, capture all he could, <span class="sidenote">Carthalo tries to
intercept the
transports.</span>
and set fire to the rest. In obedience to these
instructions Carthalo accomplished his passage
just before daybreak, fired some of the vessels,
and towed off others. Great was the commotion at the
quarters of the Romans. For as they hurried to the rescue of
the ships, the attention of Himilco, the commander of the
garrison, was aroused by their shouts; and as the day was
now beginning to break, he could see what was happening, and
despatched the mercenary troops who were in the town.
Thus the Romans found themselves surrounded by danger on
every side, and fell into a state of consternation more than
usually profound and serious. The Carthaginian admiral
contented himself with either towing off or breaking up some
few of their vessels, and shortly afterwards coasted along under
the pretence of making for Heracleia: though he was really
lying in wait, with the view of intercepting those who were
coming by sea to the Roman army. When his look-out men
brought him word that a considerable number of vessels of all
sorts were bearing down upon him, and were now getting
close, he stood out to sea and started to meet them: for the
success just obtained over the Romans inspired him with such
contempt for them, that he was eager to come to an engagement.
The vessels in question were those which had been
despatched in advance under the charge of the Quaestors
from Syracuse. And they too had warning of their danger.
Light boats were accustomed to sail in advance of a squadron,
and these announced the approach of the enemy to the
Quaestors; who being convinced that they were not strong
enough to stand a battle at sea, dropped anchor under a small
fortified town which was subject to Rome, and which, though
it had no regular harbour, yet possessed roadsteads, and headlands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
projecting from the mainland, and surrounding the
roadsteads, so as to form a convenient refuge. There they
disembarked; and having set up some catapults and ballistae,
which they got from the town, awaited the approach of the
enemy. When the Carthaginians arrived, their first idea was
to blockade them: for they supposed that the men would
be terrified and retreat to the fortified town, leaving
them to take possession of the vessels without resistance.
Their expectations, however, were not fulfilled; and finding
that the men on the contrary resisted with spirit, and that
the situation of the spot presented many difficulties of every
description, they sailed away again after towing off some
few of the transports laden with provisions, and retired to a
certain river, in which they anchored and kept a look out for
the enemy to renew their voyage.</p>

<p><a name="b1_54" id="b1_54"><b>54.</b></a> In complete ignorance of what had happened to his
advanced squadron, the Consul, who had remained behind at
Syracuse, after completing all he meant to do there, put to sea;
and, after rounding Pachynus, was proceeding on his voyage
to Lilybaeum. The appearance of the enemy was once more
signalled to the Carthaginian admiral by his look-out men,
and he at once put out to sea, with the view of engaging them
as far as possible away from their comrades. Junius saw the
Carthaginian fleet from a considerable distance, and observing
their great numbers did not dare to engage them, and yet
found it impossible to avoid them by flight because they were
now too close. He therefore steered towards land, and
anchored under a rocky and altogether dangerous part of the
shore; for he judged it better to run all risks rather than
allow his squadron, with all its men, to fall into the hands
of the enemy. The Carthaginian admiral saw what he had
done; and determined that it was unadvisable for him to
engage the enemy, or bring his ships near such a dangerous
place. He therefore made for a certain headland between the
two squadrons of the enemy, and there kept a look out upon
both with equal vigilance. Presently, however, the weather
became rough, and there was an appearance of an unusually
dangerous disturbance setting in from the sea. The Carthaginian
pilots, from their knowledge of the particular localities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
and of seamanship generally, foresaw what was coming;
and persuaded Carthalo to avoid the storm and
round the promontory of Pachynus.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> He
had the good sense to take their advice: <span class="sidenote">The Roman fleet
is wrecked.</span>and
accordingly these men, with great exertions and extreme difficulty,
did get round the promontory and anchored in safety;
while the Romans, being exposed to the storm in places entirely
destitute of harbours, suffered such complete destruction,
that not one of the wrecks even was left in a state available for
use. Both of their squadrons in fact were completely disabled
to a degree past belief.</p>

<p><a name="b1_55" id="b1_55"><b>55.</b></a> This occurrence caused the Carthaginian interests to
look up again and their hopes to revive. <span class="sidenote">The Romans
abandon the sea.</span>
But
the Romans, though they had met with partial
misfortunes before, had never suffered a naval
disaster so complete and final. They, in fact, abandoned the
sea, and confined themselves to holding the country; while the
Carthaginians remained masters of the sea, without wholly
despairing of the land.</p>

<p>Great and general was the dismay both at Rome and in
the camp at Lilybaeum. Yet they did not
abandon their determination of starving out that
town. <span class="sidenote">Lucius Junius
perseveres in the
siege. <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;248.</span>
The Roman government did not allow
their disasters to prevent their sending provisions into the
camp overland; and the besiegers kept up the investment as
strictly as they possibly could. Lucius Junius joined the
camp after the shipwreck, and, being in a state of great distress
at what had happened, was all eagerness to strike some
new and effective blow, and thus repair the disaster which
had befallen him. Accordingly he took the first slight opening
that offered to surprise and seize Eryx; <span class="sidenote">Eryx.</span>
and became master both of the temple of
Aphrodite and of the city. This is a mountain close to the
sea-coast on that side of Sicily which looks towards Italy,
between Drepana and Panormus, but nearer to Drepana
of the two. It is by far the greatest mountain in Sicily next
to Aetna; and on its summit, which is flat, stands the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>temple of Erycinian Aphrodite, confessedly the most splendid
of all the temples in Sicily for its wealth and general
magnificence. The town stands immediately below the
summit, and is approached by a very long and steep
ascent. Lucius seized both town and temple; and established
a garrison both upon the summit and at the foot
of the road to it from Drepana. He kept a strict guard
at both points, but more especially at the foot of the ascent,
believing that by so doing he should secure possession of
the whole mountain as well as the town.</p>

<p><a name="b1_56" id="b1_56"><b>56.</b></a> Next year, the eighteenth of the war, the Carthaginians
appointed Hamilcar Barcas general, and put the
management of the fleet in his hands. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;247.</span>
He
took over the command, and started to ravage the Italian
coast. After devastating the districts of Locri, and the rest
of Bruttium, he sailed away with his whole fleet
to the coast of Panormus and seized on a place
called Hercte, <span class="sidenote">Occupation of
Hercte by Hamilcar.</span>
which lies between Eryx and
Panormus on the coast, and is reputed the best situation in
the district for a safe and permanent camp. For it is a
mountain rising sheer on every side, standing out above the
surrounding country to a considerable height. The table-land
on its summit has a circumference of not less than a hundred
stades, within which the soil is rich in pasture and suitable for
agriculture; the sea-breezes render it healthy; and it is entirely
free from all dangerous animals. On the side which looks towards
the sea, as well as that which faces the central part of the
island, it is enclosed by inaccessible precipices; while the spaces
between them require only slight fortifications, and of no great
extent, to make them secure. There is in it also an eminence,
which serves at once as an acropolis and as a convenient tower
of observation, commanding the surrounding district. It also
commands a harbour conveniently situated for the passage
from Drepana and Lilybaeum to Italy, in which there is always
abundant depth of water; finally, it can only be reached by
three ways&mdash;two from the land side, one from the sea, all of
them difficult. Here Hamilcar entrenched himself. It was a
bold measure: but he had no city which he could count upon
as friendly, and no other hope on which he could rely; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
though by so doing he placed himself in the very midst of the
enemy, he nevertheless managed to involve the Romans in
many struggles and dangers. To begin with, he would start
from this place and ravage the seaboard of Italy as far as
Cumae; and again on shore, when the Romans had pitched a
camp to overawe him, in front of the city of Panormus, within
about five stades of him, he harassed them in every sort of
way, and forced them to engage in numerous skirmishes, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;247-244.</span>
for the
space of nearly three years. Of these combats
it is impossible to give a detailed account in
writing.</p>

<p><a name="b1_57" id="b1_57"><b>57.</b></a> It is like the case of two boxers, eminent alike for
their courage and their physical condition, engaged in a formal
contest for the prize. As the match goes on, blow after blow
is interchanged without intermission; but to anticipate, or keep
account of every feint or every blow delivered is impossible
for combatants and spectators alike. Still one may conceive a
sufficiently distinct idea of the affair by taking into account
the general activity of the men, the ambition actuating
each side, and the amount of their experience, strength,
and courage. The same may be said of these two generals.
No writer could set down, and no reader would endure the
wearisome and profitless task of reading, a detailed statement
of the transactions of every day; why they were undertaken,
and how they were carried out. For every day had its ambuscade
on one side or the other, its attack, or assault. A
general assertion in regard to the men, combined with the
actual result of their mutual determination to conquer, will
give a far better idea of the facts. It may be said then, generally,
that nothing was left untried,&mdash;whether it be stratagems
which could be learnt from history, or plans suggested by the
necessities of the hour and the immediate circumstances of the
case, or undertakings depending upon an adventurous spirit
and a reckless daring. The matter, however, for several
reasons, could not be brought to a decisive issue. In the first
place, the forces on either side were evenly matched: and in
the second place, while the camps were in the case of both
equally impregnable, the space which separated the two was
very small. The result of this was that skirmishes between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
detached parties on both sides were always going on during
the day, and yet nothing decisive occurred. For though the
men actually engaged in such skirmishes from time to time
were cut to pieces, it did not affect the main body. They
had only to wheel round to find themselves out of the reach
of danger behind their own defences. Once there, they could
face about and again engage the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b1_58" id="b1_58"><b>58.</b></a> Presently however Fortune, acting like a good umpire in
the games, transferred them by a bold stroke from
the locality just described, <span class="sidenote">Siege of Eryx,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;244.</span>
and the contest in
which they were engaged, to a struggle of greater
danger and a locality of narrower dimensions. The Romans,
as we have said, were in occupation of the summit of Eryx,
and had a guard stationed at its foot. But Hamilcar managed
to seize the town which lay between these two spots. There
ensued a siege of the Romans who were on the summit,
supported by them with extraordinary hardihood and adventurous
daring: while the Carthaginians, finding themselves
between two hostile armies, and their supplies brought to them
with difficulty, because they were in communication with the
sea at only one point and by one road, yet held out with a
determination that passes belief. Every contrivance which
skill or force could sustain did they put in use against each
other, as before; every imaginable privation was submitted
to; surprises and pitched battles were alike tried: and
finally they left the combat a drawn one, not, as Fabius says,
from utter weakness and misery, but like men still unbroken
and unconquered. The fact is that before either party had got
completely the better of the other, though they had maintained
the conflict for another two years, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;243-242.</span>
the war happened
to be decided in quite a different manner.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs at Eryx and with the forces
employed there. <span class="sidenote">The obstinate
persistence of
the Romans and
Carthaginians.</span>
The two nations engaged
were like well-bred game-cocks that fight to
their last gasp. You may see them often, when
too weak to use their wings, yet full of pluck to
the end, and striking again and again. Finally, chance brings
them the opportunity of once more grappling, and they hold
on until one or other of them drops down dead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b1_59" id="b1_59"><b>59.</b></a> So it was with the Romans and Carthaginians. They
were worn out by the labours of the war; the perpetual
succession of hard fought struggles was at last driving them
to despair; their strength had become paralysed, and their
resources reduced almost to extinction by war-taxes and expenses
extending over so many years. And yet the Romans
did not give in. For the last five years indeed they had
entirely abandoned the sea, partly because of the disasters they
had sustained there, and partly because they felt confident of
deciding the war by means of their land forces; but they now
determined for the third time to make trial of their fortune
in naval warfare. They saw that their operations were not
succeeding according to their calculations, mainly owing to
the obstinate gallantry of the Carthaginian general. They
therefore adopted this resolution from a conviction that by
this means alone, if their design were but well directed, would
they be able to bring the war to a successful conclusion. In
their first attempt they had been compelled to abandon the sea
by disasters arising from sheer bad luck; in their second by
the loss of the naval battle off Drepana. This third attempt
was successful: they shut off the Carthaginian forces at Eryx
from getting their supplies by sea, and eventually put a period
to the whole war. Nevertheless it was essentially an effort of
despair. <span class="sidenote">The Romans once
more fit out a
fleet.</span>
The treasury was empty, and would
not supply the funds necessary for the undertaking,
which were, however, obtained by the
patriotism and generosity of the leading citizens. They undertook
singly, or by two or three combining, according to their
means, to supply a quinquereme fully fitted out, on the understanding
that they were to be repaid if the expedition was
successful. By these means a fleet of two hundred quinqueremes
were quickly prepared, built on the model of the
ship of the Rhodian. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;242.
Coss. C.
Lutatius Catulus,
A. Postumius
Albinus.</span>
Gaius Lutatius was then
appointed to the command, and despatched at
the beginning of the summer. His appearance
on the coasts of Sicily was a surprise: the whole
of the Carthaginian fleet had gone home; and
he took possession both of the harbour near Drepana, and
the roadsteads near Lilybaeum. He then threw up works<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
round the city on Drepana, and made other preparations for
besieging it. And while he pushed on these operations with
all his might, he did not at the same time lose sight of the
approach of the Carthaginian fleet. He kept in mind the
original idea of this expedition, that it was by a victory at sea
alone that the result of the whole war could be decided. He
did not, therefore, allow the time to be wasted or unemployed.
He practised and drilled his crews every day in the man&oelig;uvres
which they would be called upon to perform; and by
his attention to discipline generally brought his sailors in a
very short time to the condition of trained athletes for the
contest before them.</p>

<p><a name="b1_60" id="b1_60"><b>60.</b></a> That the Romans should have a fleet afloat once more,
and be again bidding for the mastery at sea, was
a contingency wholly unexpected by the Carthaginians. <span class="sidenote">The Carthaginians
send Hanno
with a fleet.</span>
They at once set about fitting out
their ships, loaded them with corn and other provisions, and
despatched their fleet: determined that their troops round
Eryx should not run short of necessary provisions. Hanno,
who was appointed to command the fleet, put to sea and
arrived at the island called Holy Isle. He was eager as
soon as possible, if he could escape the observation of the
enemy, to get across to Eryx; disembark his stores; and having
thus lightened his ships, take on board as marines those of the
mercenary troops who were suitable to the service, and Barcas
with them; and not to engage the enemy until he had thus
reinforced himself. But Lutatius was informed of the arrival
of Hanno&#8217;s squadron, and correctly interpreted their design.
He at once took on board the best soldiers of his army, and
crossed to the Island of Aegusa, which lies directly opposite
Lilybaeum. There he addressed his forces some words
suitable to the occasion, and gave full instructions to the
pilots, with the understanding that a battle was to be fought
on the morrow. <span class="sidenote">10th March <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
241.
A strong breeze
is blowing.</span>
At daybreak the next morning
Lutatius found that a strong breeze had sprung
up on the stern of the enemy, and that an advance
towards them in the teeth of it would be
difficult for his ships. The sea too was rough and boisterous:
and for a while he could not make up his mind what he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
better do in the circumstances. Finally, however, he was decided
by the following considerations. If he boarded the enemy&#8217;s
fleet during the continuance of the storm, he would only have
to contend with Hanno, and the levies of sailors which he had
on board, before they could be reinforced by the troops, and with
ships which were still heavily laden with stores: but if he waited
for calm weather, and allowed the enemy to get across and
unite with their land forces, he would then have to contend
with ships lightened of their burden, and therefore in a more
navigable condition, and against the picked men of the land
forces; and what was more formidable than anything else,
against the determined bravery of Hamilcar. He made up
his mind, therefore, not to let the present opportunity
slip; <span class="sidenote">Lutatius however
decides to fight.</span>
and when he saw the enemy&#8217;s ships
crowding sail, he put to sea with all speed. The
rowers, from their excellent physical condition, found no
difficulty in overcoming the heavy sea, and Lutatius soon
got his fleet into single line with prows directed to the
foe.</p>

<p><a name="b1_61" id="b1_61"><b>61.</b></a> When the Carthaginians saw that the Romans were
intercepting their passage across, they lowered
their masts, <span class="sidenote">The battle
of Aegusa.</span>
and after some words of mutual
exhortation had been uttered in the several
ships, closed with their opponents. But the respective
state of equipment of the two sides was exactly the converse
of what it had been in the battle off Drepana; and
the result of the battle was, therefore, naturally reversed also.
The Romans had reformed their mode of shipbuilding, and
had eased their vessels of all freight, except the provisions
necessary for the battle: while their rowers having been
thoroughly trained and got well together, performed their
office in an altogether superior manner, and were backed up by
marines who, being picked men from the legions, were all but
invincible. The case with the Carthaginians was exactly the
reverse. Their ships were heavily laden and therefore unmanageable
in the engagement; while their rowers were entirely
untrained, and merely put on board for the emergency; and
such marines as they had were raw recruits, who had never
had any previous experience of any difficult or dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
service. The fact is that the Carthaginian government never
expected that the Romans would again attempt to dispute the
supremacy at sea: they had, therefore, in contempt for them,
neglected their navy. The result was that, as soon as they
closed, their manifold disadvantages quickly decided the battle
against them. <span class="sidenote">Victory of
the Romans.</span>
They had fifty ships sunk, and
seventy taken with their crews. The rest set
their sails, and running before the wind, which
luckily for them suddenly veered round at the nick of time
to help them, got away again to Holy Isle. The Roman
Consul sailed back to Lilybaeum to join the army, and there
occupied himself in making arrangements for the ships and men
which he had captured; which was a business of considerable
magnitude, for the prisoners made in the battle amounted to
little short of ten thousand.</p>

<p><a name="b1_62" id="b1_62"><b>62.</b></a> As far as strength of feeling and desire for victory were
concerned, this unexpected reverse did not diminish the
readiness of the Carthaginians to carry on the war; but when
they came to reckon up their resources they were at a complete
standstill. <span class="sidenote">Barcas makes
terms.</span>
On the one hand, they could not any longer
send supplies to their forces in Sicily, because
the enemy commanded the sea: on the other, to
abandon and, as it were, to betray these, left
them without men and without leaders to carry on the war.
They therefore sent a despatch to Barcas with all speed, leaving
the decision of the whole matter in his hands. Nor was their
confidence misplaced. He acted the part of a gallant general
and a sensible man. As long as there was any reasonable hope
of success in the business he had in hand, nothing was too
adventurous or too dangerous for him to attempt; and if any
general ever did so, he put every chance of victory to the
fullest proof. But when all his endeavours miscarried, and no
reasonable expectation was left of saving his troops, he yielded
to the inevitable, and sent ambassadors to treat of peace and
terms of accommodation. And in this he showed great good
sense and practical ability; for it is quite as much the duty of
a leader to be able to see when it is time to give in, as when
it is the time to win a victory. Lutatius was ready enough to
listen to the proposal, because he was fully aware that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
resources of Rome were at the lowest ebb from the strain of the
war; and eventually it was his fortune to put
an end to the contest by a treaty of which I here
give the terms. <span class="sidenote">The treaty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;242.</span>
&#8220;<i>Friendship is established between
the Carthaginians and Romans on the following terms, provided
always that they are ratified by the Roman people. The Carthaginians
shall evacuate the whole of Sicily: they shall not make
war upon Hiero, nor bear arms against the Syracusans or their
allies. The Carthaginians shall give up to the Romans all
prisoners without ransom. The Carthaginians shall pay to the
Romans in twenty years 2200 Euboic talents of silver.</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p><a name="b1_63" id="b1_63"><b>63.</b></a> When this treaty was sent to Rome the people refused
to accept it, but sent ten commissioners to examine into the
business. Upon their arrival they made no change in the
general terms of the treaty, but they introduced some slight
alterations in the direction of increased severity towards
Carthage. Thus they reduced the time allowed for the
payment of the indemnity by one half; they added a thousand
talents to the sum demanded; and extended the evacuation of
Sicily to all islands lying between Sicily and Italy.</p>

<p>Such were the conditions on which the war was ended, after
lasting twenty-four years continuously. <span class="sidenote">Greatness of the
war.</span>
It was
at once the longest, most continuous, and most
severely contested war known to us in history.
Apart from the other battles fought and the preparations made,
which I have described in my previous chapters, there were two
sea fights, in one of which the combined numbers of the two
fleets exceeded five hundred quinqueremes, in the other nearly
approached seven hundred. In the course of the war, counting
what were destroyed by shipwreck, the Romans lost seven
hundred quinqueremes, the Carthaginians five hundred. Those
therefore who have spoken with wonder of the sea-battles
of an Antigonus, a Ptolemy, or a Demetrius, and the greatness
of their fleets, would we may well believe have been overwhelmed
with astonishment at the hugeness of these proportions
if they had had to tell the story of this war.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> If, further,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>we take into consideration the superior size of the quinqueremes,
compared with the triremes employed by the Persians against
the Greeks, and again by the Athenians and Lacedaemonians
in their wars with each other, we shall find that never in the
whole history of the world have such enormous forces contended
for mastery at sea.</p>

<p>These considerations will establish my original observation,
and show the falseness of the opinion entertained by
certain Greeks. It was <i>not</i> by mere chance or without
knowing what they were doing that the Romans struck their
bold stroke for universal supremacy and dominion, and
justified their boldness by its success. No: it was the natural
result of discipline gained in the stern school of difficulty and
danger.</p>

<p><a name="b1_64" id="b1_64"><b>64.</b></a> And no doubt the question does naturally arise here
as to why they find it impossible in our days to man so many
ships, or take the sea with such large fleets, though masters of
the world, and possessing a superiority over others many times
as great as before. The explanation of this difficulty will be
clearly understood when we come to the description of their
civil constitution. I look upon this description as a most
important part of my work, and one demanding close attention
on the part of my readers. For the subject is calculated to
afford pleasure in the contemplation, and is up to this time
so to speak absolutely unknown, thanks to historians, some of
whom have been ignorant, while others have given so confused
an account of it as to be practically useless. For the present
it suffices to say that, as far as the late war was concerned, the
two nations were closely matched in the character of the
designs they entertained, as well as in the lofty courage they
showed in prosecuting them: and this is especially true of
the eager ambition displayed on either side to secure the
supremacy. But in the individual gallantry of their men the
Romans had decidedly the advantage; while we must credit
the Carthaginians with the best general of the day both for
genius and daring. I mean Hamilcar Barcas, own father of
Rome&#8217;s future enemy Hannibal.</p>

<p><a name="b1_65" id="b1_65"><b>65.</b></a> The confirmation of this peace was followed by events
which involved both nations in a struggle of an identical or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
similar nature. At Rome the late war was succeeded by a
social war against the Faliscans, which, however, they brought
to a speedy and successful termination by the
capture of Falerii after only a few days&#8217; siege. <span class="sidenote">War between
Rome and
Falerii.</span>
The Carthaginians were not so fortunate. Just
about the same time they found themselves confronted by three
enemies at once, their own mercenaries, the
Numidians, and such Libyans as joined the former
in their revolt. <span class="sidenote">The mercenary
war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;241.</span>
And this war proved to be
neither insignificant nor contemptible. It exposed them to frequent
and terrible alarms; and, finally, it became a question to
them not merely of a loss of territory, but of their own bare
existence, and of the safety of the very walls and buildings of
their city. There are many reasons that make it worth while
to dwell upon the history of this war: yet I must give only a
summary account of it, in accordance with the original plan of
this work. The nature and peculiar ferocity of the struggle,
which has been generally called the &#8220;truceless war,&#8221; may be
best learnt from its incidents. It conveys two important
lessons: it most conspicuously shows those who employ
mercenaries what dangers they should foresee and provide
against; and secondly, it teaches how wide the distinction is
between the character of troops composed of a confused mass
of uncivilised tribes, and of those which have had the benefit
of education, the habits of social life, and the restraints of law.
But what is of most importance to us is, that we may trace
from the actual events of this period the causes which led to
the war between Rome and Carthage in the time of Hannibal.
These causes have not only been a subject of dispute among
historians, but still continue to be so among those who were
actually engaged; it is therefore a matter of importance to
enable students to form an opinion on this matter as nearly as
possible in accordance with the truth.</p>

<p><a name="b1_66" id="b1_66"><b>66.</b></a> The course of events at Carthage subsequent to the
peace was as follows: <span class="sidenote">Evacuation of
Sicily.</span>As soon as possible
after it was finally ratified Barcas withdrew the
troops at Eryx to Lilybaeum, and then immediately
laid down his command. Gesco, who was commandant
of the town, proceeded to transport the soldiers into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Libya. But foreseeing what was likely to happen, he very
prudently embarked them in detachments, and did not send
them all in one voyage. His object was to gain time for the
Carthaginian government; so that one detachment should
come to shore, receive the pay due to them, and depart from
Carthage to their own country, before the next detachment was
brought across and joined them. In accordance with this idea
Gesco began the transportation of the troops. But the Government&mdash;partly
because the recent expenses had reduced their
finances to a low ebb, partly because they felt certain that, if
they collected the whole force and entertained them in Carthage,
they would be able to persuade the mercenaries to
accept something less than the whole pay due to them&mdash;did
not dismiss the detachments as they landed, but kept them
massed in the city. But when this resulted in the commission
of many acts of lawlessness by night and day, they began to
feel uneasy at their numbers and their growing licentiousness;
and required the officers, until such time as arrangements for
discharging their pay should have been made, and the rest of
the army should have arrived, to withdraw with <span class="sidenote">The mercenaries
sent to Sicca.</span>
all their men to a certain town called Sicca,
receiving each a piece of gold for their immediate
necessities. As far as quitting the city was concerned
they were ready enough to obey; but they desired to leave
their heavy baggage there as before, on the ground that they
would soon have to return to the city for their wages. But
the Carthaginian government were in terror lest, considering
the length of their absence and their natural desire for the
society of wives or children, they would either not quit the city
at all; or, if they did, would be sure to be enticed by these feelings
to return, and that thus there would be no decrease of
outrages in the city. Accordingly they forced them to take
their baggage with them: but it was sorely against the will of
the men, and roused strong feelings of animosity among them.
These mercenaries being forced to retire to Sicca, lived there
as they chose without any restraint upon their lawlessness.
For they had obtained two things the most demoralising for
hired forces, and which in a word are in themselves the all-sufficient
source and origin of mutinies,&mdash;relaxation of discipline<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
and want of employment.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> For lack of something better to do,
some of them began calculating, always to their own advantage,
the amount of pay owing to them; and thus making out the
total to be many times more than was really due, they gave out
that this was the amount which they ought to demand from
the Carthaginians. Moreover they all began to call to mind
the promises made to them by the generals in their harangues,
delivered on various occasions of special danger, and to entertain
high hopes and great expectations of the amount of compensation
which awaited them. The natural result followed.</p>

<p><a name="b1_67" id="b1_67"><b>67.</b></a> When the whole army had mustered at Sicca, and Hanno,
now appointed general in Libya, <span class="sidenote">The beginning
of the outbreak,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;241.</span>
far from satisfying
these hopes and the promises they had received,
talked on the contrary of the burden of the taxes
and the embarrassment of the public finances; and actually
endeavoured to obtain from them an abatement even from the
amount of pay acknowledged to be due to them; excited and
mutinous feelings at once began to manifest themselves. There
were constant conferences hastily got together, sometimes in
separate nationalities, sometimes of the whole army; and there
being no unity of race or language among them, the whole camp
became a babel of confusion, a scene of inarticulate tumult, and
a veritable revel of misrule. For the Carthaginians being
always accustomed to employ mercenary troops of miscellaneous
nationalities, in securing that an army should consist of several
different races, act wisely as far as the prevention of any rapid
combinations for mutiny, or difficulty on the part of the commanders
in overawing insubordination, are concerned: but the
policy utterly breaks down when an outburst of anger, or
popular delusion, or internal dissension, has actually occurred;
for it makes it impossible for the commander to soothe excited
feelings, to remove misapprehensions, or to show the ignorant
their error. Armies in such a state are not usually content
with mere human wickedness; they end by assuming the
ferocity of wild beasts and the vindictiveness of insanity.</p>

<p>This is just what happened in this case. There were in the
army Iberians and Celts, men from Liguria and the Balearic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>Islands, and a considerable number of half-bred Greeks,
mostly deserters and slaves; while the main body consisted of
Libyans. Consequently it was impossible to collect and address
them <i>en masse</i>, or to approach them with this view by any
means whatever. There was no help for it: the general could
not possibly know their several languages; and to make a
speech four or five times on the same subject, by the mouths
of several interpreters, was almost more impossible, if I may say
so, than that. The only alternative was for him to address his
entreaties and exhortations to the soldiers through their officers.
And this Hanno continually endeavoured to do. But there
was the same difficulty with them. Sometimes they failed to
understand what he said: at others they received his words
with expressions of approval to his face, and yet from error or
malice reported them in a contrary sense to the common soldiers.
The result was a general scene of uncertainty, mistrust,
and misunderstanding. And to crown all, they took it into
their heads that the Carthaginian government had a design in
thus sending Hanno to them: that they purposely did not
send the generals who were acquainted with the services they
had rendered in Sicily, and who had been the authors of the
promises made to them; but had sent the one man who had
not been present at any of these transactions. Whether that
were so or not, they finally broke off all negotiations with
Hanno; conceived a violent mistrust of their several commanders;
and in a furious outburst of anger with the Carthaginians
started towards the city, and pitched their camp about
a hundred and twenty stades from Carthage, at the town of
Tunes, to the number of over twenty thousand.</p>

<p><a name="b1_68" id="b1_68"><b>68.</b></a> The Carthaginians saw their folly when it was too late.
It was a grave mistake to have collected so
large a number of mercenaries into one place <span class="sidenote">The mercenaries
at Tunes.</span>
without any warlike force of their own citizens
to fall back upon: but it was a still graver mistake to have
delivered up to them their children and wives, with their heavy
baggage to boot; which they might have retained as hostages,
and thus have had greater security for concerting their own
measures, and more power of ensuring obedience to their
orders. However, being thoroughly alarmed at the action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
of the men in regard to their encampment, they went to every
length in their eagerness to pacify their anger. They sent
them supplies of provisions in rich abundance, <span class="sidenote">Attempts to
pacify them.</span>
to be purchased exactly on their own terms,
and at their own price. Members of the Senate
were despatched, one after the other, to treat with them; and
they were promised that whatever they demanded should be
conceded if it were within the bounds of possibility. Day by
day the ideas of the mercenaries rose higher. For their contempt
became supreme when they saw the dismay and excitement
in Carthage; <span class="sidenote">The demands of
the mercenaries.</span>their confidence in themselves
was profound; and their engagements
with the Roman legions in Sicily had convinced
them, that not only was it impossible for the Carthaginians to
face them in the field, but that it would be difficult to find any
nation in the world who could. Therefore, when the Carthaginians
conceded the point of their pay, they made a further
claim for the value of the horses they had lost. When this
too was conceded, they said that they ought to receive the
value of the rations of corn due to them from a long time previous,
reckoned at the highest price reached during the war.
And in short, the ill-disposed and mutinous among them being
numerous, they always found out some new demand which
made it impossible to come to terms. Upon the Carthaginian
government, however, pledging themselves to the full extent
of their powers, they eventually agreed to refer the matter to
the arbitration of some one of the generals who had been
actually engaged in Sicily. Now they were displeased with
Hamilcar Barcas, who was one of those under whom they had
fought in Sicily, because they thought that their present unfavourable
position was attributable chiefly to him. <span class="sidenote">The dispute referred
to the
arbitration
of Gesco.</span>
They
thought this from the fact that he never came to them as an
ambassador, and had, as was believed, voluntarily resigned his
command. But towards Gesco their feelings
were altogether friendly. He had, as they
thought, taken every possible precaution for
their interests, and especially in the arrangements
for their conveyance to Libya. Accordingly they referred
the dispute to the arbitration of the latter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b1_69" id="b1_69"><b>69.</b></a> Gesco came to Tunes by sea, bringing the money with
him. There he held a meeting first of the officers, and then
of the men, according to their nationalities; rebuked them for
their past behaviour, and endeavoured to convince them as to
their duty in the present: but most of all he dwelt upon their
obligation in the future to show themselves well-disposed towards
the people whose pay they had been so long enjoying.
Finally, he proceeded to discharge the arrears of pay, taking
each nationality separately. But there was a certain Campanian
in the army, <span class="sidenote">Spendius.</span>
a runaway Roman slave
named Spendius, a man of extraordinary physical
strength and reckless courage in the field. Alarmed lest
his master should recover possession of him, and he should
be put to death with torture, in accordance with the laws of
Rome, this man exerted himself to the utmost in word and
deed to break off the arrangement with the Carthaginians.
He was seconded by a Libyan called Math&#333;s, <span class="sidenote">Math&#333;s.</span>
who was not a slave but free, and had actually
served in the campaign. But he had been one of the most
active agitators in the late disturbances: and being in terror
of punishment for the past, he now gave in his adhesion to
the party of Spendius; and taking the Libyans aside, suggested
to them that, when the men of other races had received their
pay, and taken their departure to their several countries, the
Carthaginians would wreak upon them the full weight of the
resentment which they had, in common with themselves, incurred;
and would look upon their punishment as a means of
striking terror into all the inhabitants of Libya. It did not
take long to rouse the men by such arguments, nor were they
at a loss for a pretext, however insignificant. In discharging
the pay, Gesco postponed the payment of the valuations of
rations and horses. <span class="sidenote">Spendius and
Math&#333;s cause an
outbreak.</span>
This was enough: the
men at once hurried to make a meeting; Spendius
and Math&#333;s delivered violent invectives
against Gesco and the Carthaginians; their words were received
with every sign of approval; no one else could get a
hearing; whoever did attempt to speak was promptly stoned
to death, without the assembly so much as waiting to ascertain
whether he intended to support the party of Spendius or no.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>A considerable number of privates as well as officers were
killed in this manner in the various <i>&eacute;meutes</i> which took place;
and from the constant repetition of this act of violence the
whole army learnt the meaning of the word <span class="sidenote">&#946;&#8049;&#955;&#955;&#949;.</span>
&#8220;throw,&#8221; although there was not another word
which was intelligible to them all in common. The most
usual occasion for this to happen was when they collected
in crowds flushed with wine after their midday meal. On
such occasions, if only some one started the cry &#8220;throw,&#8221; such
volleys were poured in from every side, and with such rapidity,
that it was impossible for any one to escape who once ventured
to stand forward to address them. The result was that
soon no one had the courage to offer them any counsel at all;
and they accordingly appointed Math&#333;s and Spendius as their&#333;
commanders.</p>

<p><a name="b1_70" id="b1_70"><b>70.</b></a> This complete disorganisation and disorder did not
escape the observation of Gesco. But his chief anxiety was
to secure the safety of his country; and seeing clearly that, if
these men were driven to exasperation, the Carthaginians
would be in danger of total destruction, he exerted himself
with desperate courage and persistence: sometimes summoning
their officers, sometimes calling a meeting of the men
according to their nationalities and remonstrating with them.
But on one occasion the Libyans, not having received their
wages as soon as they considered that they ought to have been
paid to them, approached Gesco himself with
some insolence. <span class="sidenote">Gesco and his
staff seized and
thrown into chains.</span>
With the idea of rebuking
their precipitancy he refused to produce the pay,
and bade them &#8220;go and ask their general Math&#333;s
for it.&#8221; This so enraged them, that without a moment&#8217;s delay
they first made a raid upon the money that was kept in
readiness, and then arrested Gesco and the Carthaginians
with him. Math&#333;s and Spendius thought that the speediest
way to secure an outbreak of war was for the men to commit
some outrage upon the sanctity of law and in violation of their
engagements. They therefore co-operated with the mass of
the men in their reckless outrages; plundered the baggage of
the Carthaginians along with their money; manacled Gesco and
his staff with every mark of insolent violence, and committed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
them into custody. Thenceforth they were at open war with
Carthage, having bound themselves together by oaths which
were at once impious and contrary to the principles universally
received among mankind.</p>

<p>This was the origin and beginning of the mercenary, or, as
it is also called, the Libyan war. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;240.</span>Math&#333;s lost no
time after this outrage in sending emissaries to
the various cities in Libya, urging them to assert their freedom,
and begging them to come to their aid and join them in their
undertaking. The appeal was successful: nearly all the cities
in Libya readily listened to the proposal that they should revolt
against Carthage, and were soon zealously engaged in sending
them supplies and reinforcements. They therefore divided
themselves into two parties; one of which laid siege to Utica,
the other to Hippo Zarytus, because these two cities refused
to participate in the revolt.</p>

<p><a name="b1_71" id="b1_71"><b>71.</b></a> Three things must be noticed in regard to the Carthaginians.
First, among them the means of life of private
persons are supplied by the produce of the land; secondly, all
public expenses for war material and stores are discharged
from the tribute paid by the people of Libya; and thirdly, it is
their regular custom to carry on war by means of mercenary
troops. At this moment they not only found themselves unexpectedly
deprived of all these resources at once, but saw
each one of them actually employed against
themselves. <span class="sidenote">Despair at
Carthage.</span>Such an unlooked-for event
naturally reduced them to a state of great
discouragement and despair. After the long agony of the
Sicilian war they were in hopes, when the peace was ratified,
that they might obtain some breathing space and some period
of settled content. The very reverse was now befalling them.
They were confronted by an outbreak of war still more difficult
and formidable. In the former they were disputing with Rome
for the possession of Sicily: but this was a domestic war, and
the issue at stake was the bare existence of themselves and
their country. Besides, the many battles in which they had
been engaged at sea had naturally left them ill supplied with
arms, sailors, and vessels. They had no store of provisions
ready, and no expectation whatever of external assistance from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
friends or allies. They were indeed now thoroughly taught
the difference between a foreign war, carried on beyond the
seas, and a domestic insurrection and disturbance.</p>

<p><a name="b1_72" id="b1_72"><b>72.</b></a> And for these overpowering miseries they had themselves
to thank more than any one else. During the late war
they had availed themselves of what they regarded as a reasonable
pretext for exercising their supremacy over the inhabitants
of Libya with excessive harshness. They had exacted half of
all agricultural produce; had doubled the tribute of the towns;
and, in levying these contributions, had refused to show any
grace or indulgence whatever to those who were in embarrassed
circumstances. Their admiration and rewards were reserved,
not for those generals who treated the people with mildness
and humanity, but exclusively for those who like Hanno secured
them the most abundant supplies and war material,
though at the cost of the harshest treatment of the provincials.</p>

<p>These people therefore needed no urging to revolt: a
single messenger sufficed. <span class="sidenote">Revolt of the
country people.</span>
The women, who
up to this time had passively looked on while
their husbands and fathers were being led off to
prison for the non-payment of the taxes, now bound themselves
by an oath in their several towns that they would conceal
nothing that they possessed; and, stripping off their ornaments,
unreservedly contributed them to furnish pay for the
soldiers. They thus put such large means into the hands of
Math&#333;s and Spendius, that they not only discharged the
arrears due to the mercenaries, which they had promised them
as an inducement to mutiny, but remained well supplied for
future needs. A striking illustration of the fact that true policy
does not regard only the immediate necessities of the hour,
but must ever look still more keenly to the future.</p>

<p><a name="b1_73" id="b1_73"><b>73.</b></a> No such considerations, however, prevented the
Carthaginians in their hour of distress from
appointing Hanno general; <span class="sidenote">Hanno&#8217;s management
of the war.</span>because he had the
credit of having on a former occasion reduced
the city called Hecatompylos, in Libya, to obedience. They
also set about collecting mercenaries; arming their own citizens
who were of military age; training and drilling the city cavalry;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
and refitting what were left of their ships, triremes, penteconters,
and the largest of the pinnaces. Meanwhile Math&#333;s,
being joined by as many as seventy thousand Libyans, distributed
these fresh troops between the two forces which were
besieging Utica and Hippo Zarytus, and carried on those
sieges without let or hindrance. At the same time they kept
firm possession of the encampment at Tunes, and had thus
shut out the Carthaginians from the whole of outer Libya.
For Carthage itself stands on a projecting peninsula in a gulf,
nearly surrounded by the sea and in part also by a lake. The
isthmus that connects it with Libya is three miles broad: upon
one side of this isthmus, in the direction of the open sea and
at no great distance, stands the city of Utica, and on the other
stands Tunes, upon the shore of the lake. The mercenaries
occupied both these points, and having thus cut off the Carthaginians
from the open country, proceeded to take measures
against Utica itself. They made frequent excursions up to
the town wall, sometimes by day and sometimes by night, and
were continually throwing the citizens into a state of alarm and
absolute panic.</p>

<p><a name="b1_74" id="b1_74"><b>74.</b></a> Hanno, however, was busying himself with some success
in providing defences. In this department of a general&#8217;s
duty he showed considerable ability; but he was quite a
different man at the head of a sally in force: he was not
sagacious in his use of opportunities, and managed the whole
business with neither skill nor promptitude. It was thus that
his first expedition miscarried when he went to <span class="sidenote">Fails to relieve
Utica.</span>
relieve Utica. The number of his elephants,
of which he had as many as a hundred, struck
terror into the enemy; yet he made so poor a use of this
advantage that, instead of turning it into a complete victory,
he very nearly brought the besieged, as well as himself, to
utter destruction. He brought from Carthage catapults and
darts, and in fact all the apparatus for a siege; and having
encamped outside Utica undertook an assault upon the
enemy&#8217;s entrenchment. The elephants forced their way into
the camp, and the enemy, unable to withstand their weight and
the fury of their attack, entirely evacuated the position. They
lost a large number from wounds inflicted by the elephants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>&#8217;
tusks; while the survivors made their way to a certain hill,
which was a kind of natural fortification thickly covered with
trees, and there halted, relying upon the strength of the position.
But Hanno, accustomed to fight with Numidians and
Libyans, who, once turned, never stay their flight till they
are two days removed from the scene of the action, imagined
that he had already put an end to the war and had gained a
complete victory. He therefore troubled himself no more
about his men, or about the camp generally, but went inside
the town and occupied himself with his own personal comfort.
But the mercenaries, who had fled in a body on to the hill,
had been trained in the daring tactics of Barcas, and accustomed
from their experience in the Sicilian warfare to retreat
and return again to the attack many times in the same day.
They now saw that the general had left his army and gone
into the town, and that the soldiers, owing to their victory,
were behaving carelessly, and in fact slipping out of the camp
in various directions: they accordingly got themselves into
order and made an assault upon the camp; killed a large
number of the men; forced the rest to fly ignominiously to
the protection of the city walls and gates; and possessed
themselves of all the baggage and apparatus belonging to
the besieged, which Hanno had brought outside the town in
addition to his own, and thus put into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>But this was not the only instance of his incompetence.
A few days afterwards, near a place called
Gorza, he came right upon the enemy, who lay <span class="sidenote">Hanno&#8217;s continued
ill success.</span>
encamped there, and had two opportunities of
securing a victory by pitched battles; and two more by surprising
them, as they changed quarters close to where he was.
But in both cases he let the opportunities slip for want of
care and proper calculation.</p>

<p><a name="b1_75" id="b1_75"><b>75.</b></a> The Carthaginians, therefore, when they saw his mismanagement
of the campaign, once more placed
Hamilcar Barcas at the head of affairs; and despatched
him to the war as commander-in-chief, <span class="sidenote">Hamilcar Barcas
takes the command.</span>
with seventy elephants, the newly-collected mercenaries, and
the deserters from the enemy; and along with them the
cavalry and infantry enrolled from the citizens themselves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
amounting in all to ten thousand men. His appearance from
the first produced an immediate impression. The expedition
was unexpected; and he was thus able, by the dismay which it
produced, to lower the courage of the enemy. He succeeded
in raising the siege of Utica, and showed himself worthy of
his former achievements, and of the confidence felt in him by
the people. What he accomplished on this service was this.</p>

<p>A chain of hills runs along the isthmus connecting Carthage
with the mainland, which are difficult of access, and are crossed
by artificial passes into the mainland; of these hills Math&#333;s
had occupied all the available points and posted guards there.
Besides these there is a river called Macaras (Bagradas), which
at certain points interrupts the passage of travellers from the
city to the mainland, and though for the most <span class="sidenote">He gets his men
across the Macaras.</span>
part impassable, owing to the strength of its
stream, is only crossed by one bridge. This
means of egress also Math&#333;s was guarding securely, and had
built a town on it. The result was that, to say nothing of
the Carthaginians entering the mainland with an army, it was
rendered exceedingly difficult even for private individuals, who
might wish to make their way through, to elude the vigilance
of the enemy. This did not escape the observation and care
of Hamilcar; and while revolving every means and every
chance of putting an end to this difficulty about a passage, he
at length hit upon the following. He observed that where
the river discharges itself into the sea its mouth got silted up
in certain positions of the wind, and that then the passage
over the river at its mouth became like that over a marsh.
He accordingly got everything ready in the camp for the
expedition, without telling any one what he was going to do;
and then watched for this state of things to occur. When the
right moment arrived, he started under cover of night; and by
daybreak had, without being observed by any one, got his army
across this place, to the surprise of the citizens of Utica as well
as of the enemy. Marching across the plain, he led his men
straight against the enemy who were guarding the bridge.</p>

<p><a name="b1_76" id="b1_76"><b>76.</b></a> When he understood what had taken place Spendius advanced
into the plain to meet Hamilcar. The force from the city
at the bridge amounted to ten thousand men; that from before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Utica to more than fifteen thousand men; both of which now
advanced to support each other. When they had
effected a junction they imagined that they had <span class="sidenote">And defeats
Spendius.</span>
the Carthaginians in a trap, and therefore with
mutual words of exhortation passed the order to engage, and at
once commenced. Hamilcar was marching with his elephants in
front, his cavalry and light troops next, while his heavy armed
hoplites brought up the rear. But when he saw the precipitation
of the enemy&#8217;s attack, he passed the word to his men to turn
to the rear. His instructions were that the troops in front
should, after thus turning to the rear, retire with all speed:
while he again wheeled to the right about what had been originally
his rear divisions, and got them into line successively so as
to face the enemy. The Libyans and mercenaries mistook the
object of this movement, and imagined that the Carthaginians
were panic-stricken and in full retreat. Thereupon they broke
from their ranks and, rushing forward, began a vigorous hand
to hand struggle. When, however, they found that the cavalry
had wheeled round again, and were drawn up close to the hoplites,
and that the rest of the army also was being brought up,
surprise filled the Libyans with panic; they immediately turned
and began a retreat as precipitate and disorderly as their
advance. In the blind flight which followed some of them
ran foul of their own rear-guard, who were still advancing, and
caused their own destruction or that of their comrades; but
the greater part were trampled to death by the cavalry and
elephants who immediately charged. As many as six thousand
of the Libyans and foreign troops were killed, and about
two thousand taken prisoners. The rest made good their
escape, either to the town on the bridge or to the camp near
Utica. After this victory Hamilcar followed close upon the
heels of the enemy, carried the town on the bridge by assault,
the enemy there abandoning it and flying to Tunes, and then
proceeded to scour the rest of the district: some of the towns
submitting, while the greater number he had to reduce by
force. And thus he revived in the breasts of the Carthaginians
some little spirit and courage, or at least rescued them from
the state of absolute despair into which they had fallen.</p>

<p><a name="b1_77" id="b1_77"><b>77.</b></a> Meanwhile Math&#333;s himself was continuing the siege<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
of Hippo Zarytus, and he now counselled Autaritus, the
leader of the Gauls, and Spendius to stick close
to the skirts of the enemy, avoiding the plains, <span class="sidenote">Math&#333;s harasses
Hamilcar&#8217;s march.</span>
because the enemy were strong in cavalry
and elephants, but marching parallel with them on the slopes
of the mountains, and attacking them whenever they saw them
in any difficulty. While suggesting these tactics, he at the
same time sent messengers to the Numidians and Libyans,
entreating them to come to their aid, and not to let slip the
opportunity of securing their own freedom. Accordingly,
Spendius took with him a force of six thousand men, selected
from each of the several nationalities at Tunes, and started,
keeping along a line of hills parallel to the Carthaginians.
Besides these six thousand he had two thousand Gauls under
Autaritus, who were all that were left of the original number,
the rest having deserted to the Romans during the period of
the occupation of Eryx. Now it happened that, just when
Hamilcar had taken up a position in a certain plain which
was surrounded on all sides by mountains, the reinforcements
of Numidians and Libyans joined Spendius. The Carthaginians,
therefore, suddenly found a Libyan encampment
right on their front, another of Numidians on their rear, and
that of Spendius on their flank; and it seemed impossible to
escape from the danger which thus menaced them on every
side.</p>

<p><a name="b1_78" id="b1_78"><b>78.</b></a> But there was at that time a certain Nar&aacute;vas, a Numidian
of high rank and warlike spirit, who entertained
an ancestral feeling of affection for the Carthaginians, <span class="sidenote">Hamilcar is joined
by the Numidian Nar&aacute;vas.</span>
rendered especially warm at that
time by admiration for Hamilcar. He now thought that he
had an excellent opportunity for an interview and association
with that general; and accordingly came to the Carthaginian
quarters with a body of a hundred Numidians, and boldly approaching
the out-works, remained there waving his hand.
Wondering what his object could be Hamilcar sent a horseman
to see; to whom Nar&aacute;vas said that he wished for an interview
with the general. The Carthaginian leader still showing hesitation
and incredulity, Nar&aacute;vas committed his horse and javelins
to the care of his guards, and boldly came into the camp unarmed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
His fearlessness made a profound impression not unmixed
with surprise. No further objection, however, was made
to his presence, and the desired interview was accorded; in
which he declared his goodwill to the Carthaginians generally,
and his especial desire to be friends with Barcas. &#8220;This was
the motive of his presence,&#8221; he said; &#8220;he was come with the
full intention of taking his place by his side and of faithfully
sharing all his actions and undertakings.&#8221; Hamilcar, on hearing
these words, was so immensely charmed by the young man&#8217;s
courage in coming, and his honest simplicity in the interview,
that he not only consented to accept his co-operation, but promised
also with an oath that he would give him his daughter in
marriage if he kept faith with Carthage to the end. The agreement
having been thus made, Nar&aacute;vas came with his division of
Numidians, numbering two thousand. Thus reinforced Hamilcar
offered the enemy battle; which Spendius, having joined forces
with the Libyans, accepted; and descending into <span class="sidenote">Again defeats
Spendius.</span>
the plain engaged the Carthaginians. In the
severe battle which followed Hamilcar&#8217;s army
was victorious: a result which he owed partly to the excellent
behaviour of the elephants, but particularly to the brilliant
services rendered by Nar&aacute;vas. Autaritus and Spendius managed
to escape; but of the rest as many as ten thousand were killed and
four thousand taken prisoners. When the victory was complete,
Hamilcar gave permission to those of the prisoners who chose
to enlist in his army, and furnished them with arms from the
spoils of the enemy&#8217;s slain: those who did not choose to accept
this offer he summoned to a meeting and harangued them.
He told them that the crimes committed by them up to that
moment were pardoned, and they were permitted to go their
several ways, wheresoever they chose, but on condition that
none of them bore arms against Carthage again: if any one of
them were ever caught so doing, he warned them distinctly
that he would meet with no mercy.</p>

<p><a name="b1_79" id="b1_79"><b>79.</b></a> This conspiracy of Math&#333;s and Spendius caused an
outbreak about this same time in another
quarter. For the mercenaries who were in <span class="sidenote">Mutiny in
Sardinia.</span>
garrison in Sardinia, inspired by their example,
attacked the Carthaginians in the island; beleaguered Bostarus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the commander of the foreign contingent, in the citadel; and
finally put him and his compatriots to the sword. The
Carthaginians thereupon sent another army into the island
under Hanno. But the men deserted to the mutineers; who
then seized Hanno and crucified him, and exercising all their
ingenuity in the invention of tortures racked to death every
Carthaginian in the island. Having got the towns into their
power, they thenceforth kept forcible possession of the island;
until they quarrelled with the natives and were driven by them
into Italy. This was the way in which Carthage lost Sardinia,
an island of first rate importance from its size, the number of
its inhabitants, and its natural products. But as many have
described it at great length, I do not think that I need repeat
statements about which there is no manner of dispute.</p>

<p>To return to Libya. The indulgence shown by Hamilcar
to the captives alarmed Math&#333;s and Spendius
and Autaritus the Gaul. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;239.
Plan of Spendius
for doing away
with the good
impression made
by the leniency of
Barcas.</span>They were afraid that
conciliatory treatment of this sort would induce
the Libyans, and the main body of the mercenaries,
to embrace with eagerness the impunity
thus displayed before their eyes. They consulted
together, therefore, how they might by some new act
of infamy inflame to the highest pitch of fury the feelings of
their men against the Carthaginians. They finally determined
upon the following plan. They summoned a meeting of the
soldiers; and when it was assembled, they introduced a bearer
of a despatch which they represented to have been sent by
their fellow conspirators in Sardinia. The despatch warned
them to keep a careful watch over Gesco and all his fellow
prisoners (whom, as has been stated, they had treacherously
seized in Tunes), as certain persons in the camp were secretly
negotiating with the Carthaginians for their release. Taking
this as his text, Spendius commenced by urging the men not
to put any trust in the indulgence shown by the Carthaginian
general to the prisoners of war, &#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is with no
intention of saving their lives that he adopted this course in
regard to the prisoners; his aim was, by releasing them, to get
us into his power, that punishment might not be confined to
some of us, but might fall on all at once.&#8221; He went on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
urge them to be on their guard, lest by letting Gesco&#8217;s party
go they should teach their enemies to despise them; and should
also do great practical damage to their own interests, by suffering
a man to escape who was an excellent general, and likely
to be a most formidable enemy to themselves. Before he had
finished this speech another courier arrived, pretending to
have been sent by the garrison at Tunes, and bearing a
despatch containing warnings similar to that from Sardinia.</p>

<p><a name="b1_80" id="b1_80"><b>80.</b></a> It was now the turn of Autaritus the Gaul. &#8220;Your only
hope,&#8221; he said, &#8220;of safety is to reject all hopes which rest on
the Carthaginians. So long as any man clings to the idea of
indulgence at their hands, he cannot possibly be a genuine
ally of yours. Never trust, never listen, never attend to anyone,
unless he recommend unrelenting hostility and implacable
hatred towards the Carthaginians: all who speak on the other
side regard as traitors and enemies.&#8221; After this preface, he
gave it as his advice that they should put to death with torture
both Gesco and those who had been seized with him, as well
as the Carthaginian prisoners of war who had been captured
since. Now this Autaritus was the most effective speaker of
any, because he could make himself understood to a large
number of those present at a meeting. For, owing to his
length of service, he knew how to speak Phoenician; and
Phoenician was the language in which the largest number of
men, thanks to the length of the late war, could listen to
with satisfaction. Accordingly his speech was received with
acclamation, and he stood down amidst loud applause. But
when many came forward from the several nationalities at
the same time; and, moved by Gesco&#8217;s former kindnesses to
themselves, would have deprecated at least the infliction of
torture, not a word of what they said was understood: partly
because many were speaking at the same time, and partly
because each spoke in his own language. But when at
length it was disclosed that what they meant was to dissuade
the infliction of torture, upon one of those present shouting
out &#8220;Throw!&#8221; they promptly stoned to death all who had
come forward to speak; and their relations <span class="sidenote">Murder of Gesco.</span>
buried their bodies, which were crushed into
shapeless masses as though by the feet of elephants. Still they at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
least were buried. But the followers of Spendius now seized
Gesco and his fellow prisoners, numbering about seven
hundred, led them outside the stockade, and having made
them march a short distance from the camp, first cut off their
hands, beginning with Gesco, the man whom a short while
before they had selected out of all Carthage as their benefactor
and had chosen as arbitrator in their controversy. When they
had cut off their hands, they proceeded to lop off the extremities
of the unhappy men, and having thus mutilated
them and broken their legs, they threw them still alive into a
trench.</p>

<p><a name="b1_81" id="b1_81"><b>81.</b></a> When news of this dreadful affair reached the Carthaginians,
they were powerless indeed to do anything, but they were
filled with horror; and in a transport of agony despatched messengers
to Hamilcar and the second general Hanno, entreating
them to rally to their aid and avenge the unhappy victims;
and at the same time they sent heralds to the authors of this
crime to negotiate for the recovery of the dead bodies. But
the latter sternly refused; and warned the messengers to send
neither herald nor ambassador to them again; for the same
punishment which had just befallen Gesco awaited all who
came. And for the future they passed a resolution, which
they encouraged each other to observe, to put every Carthaginian
whom they caught to death with torture; and that
whenever they captured one of their auxiliaries they would cut
off his hands and send him back to Carthage. And this
resolution they exactly and persistently carried out. Such
horrors justify the remark that it is not only the bodies of men,
and the ulcers and imposthumes which are bred in them, that
grow to a fatal and completely incurable state of inflammation,
but their souls also most of all. For as in the case of
ulcers, sometimes medical treatment on the one hand only
serves to irritate them and make them spread more rapidly,
while if, on the other hand, the medical treatment is stopped,
having nothing to check their natural destructiveness, they
gradually destroy the substance on which they feed; just so at
times it happens that similar plague spots and gangrenes fasten
upon men&#8217;s souls; and when this is so, no wild beast can be
more wicked or more cruel than a man. To men in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
frame of mind if you show indulgence or kindness, they regard
it as a cover for trickery and sinister designs, and only become
more suspicious and more inflamed against the authors of it;
while if you retaliate, their passions are aroused to a kind of
dreadful rivalry, and then there is no crime too monstrous or
too cruel for them to commit. The upshot with these men
was, that their feelings became so brutalised that they lost the
instincts of humanity: which we must ascribe in the first place,
and to the greatest extent, to uncivilised habits and a
wretchedly bad early training; but many other things contributed
to this result, and among them we must reckon as
most important the acts of violence and rapacity committed by
their leaders, sins which at that time were prevalent among
the whole mercenary body, but especially so with their leaders.</p>

<p><a name="b1_82" id="b1_82"><b>82.</b></a> Alarmed by the recklessness displayed by the enemy,
Hamilcar summoned Hanno to join him, being convinced that
a consolidation of the two armies would give him the best
chance of putting an end to the whole war. Such of the
enemy as he took in the field he put to execution on the spot,
while those who were made prisoners and brought to him he
threw to the elephants to be trampled to death; for he now
made up his mind that the only possibility of <span class="sidenote">Quarrels of
Hanno and
Hamilcar.</span>
finishing the war was to entirely destroy the
enemy. But just as the Carthaginians were
beginning to entertain brighter hopes in regard to the
war, a reverse as complete as it was unexpected brought
their fortunes to the lowest ebb. For these two generals,
when they had joined forces, quarrelled so bitterly with
each other, that they not only omitted to take advantage of
chances against the enemy, but by their mutual animosity gave
the enemy many opportunities against themselves. Finding
this to be the case, the Carthaginian government sent out
instructions that one of the generals was to retire, the other to
remain, and that the army itself was to decide which of them
it should be. This was one cause of the reverse in the fortunes
of Carthage at this time. Another, which was almost contemporaneous,
was this. Their chief hope of furnishing the army
with provisions and other necessaries rested upon the supplies
that were being brought from a place to which they give the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
name of Emporiae: but as these supplies were on their way,
they were overtaken by a storm at sea and entirely destroyed.
This was all the more fatal because Sardinia was lost to them
at the time, as we have seen, and that island had always been
of the greatest service to them in difficulties of this sort. But
the worst blow of all was the revolt of the <span class="sidenote">Revolt of Hippo
Zarytus and
Utica.</span>
cities of Hippo Zarytus and Utica, the only
cities in all Libya that had been faithful to
them, not only in the present war, but also at the time of the
invasion of Agathocles, as well as that of the Romans. To
both these latter they had offered a gallant resistance; and,
in short, had never at any time adopted any policy hostile to
Carthage. But now they were not satisfied with simply revolting
to the Libyans, without any reason to allege for their conduct.
With all the bitterness of turncoats, they suddenly paraded
an ostentatious friendship and fidelity to them, and gave
practical expression to implacable rage and hatred towards the
Carthaginians. They killed every man of the force which had
come from Carthage to their aid, as well as its commander,
and threw the bodies from the wall. They surrendered their
town to the Libyans, while they even refused the request of
the Carthaginians to be allowed to bury the corpses of their
unfortunate soldiers. Math&#333;s and Spendius were so elated by
these events that they were emboldened to attempt Carthage
itself. But Barcas had now got Hannibal as his coadjutor,
who had been sent by the citizens to the army in the place of
Hanno,&mdash;recalled in accordance with the sentence of the
army, which the government had left to their discretion in
reference to the disputes that arose between the two generals.
Accompanied, therefore, by this Hannibal and by Nar&aacute;vas,
Hamilcar scoured the country to intercept the supplies of
Math&#333;s and Spendius, receiving his most efficient support in
this, as in other things, from the Numidian Nar&aacute;vas.</p>

<p><a name="b1_83" id="b1_83"><b>83.</b></a> Such being the position of their forces in the field, the
Carthaginians, finding themselves hemmed in on every side,
were compelled to have recourse to the help of the free states in
alliance with them.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> Now Hiero, of Syracuse, had during this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
war been all along exceedingly anxious to do everything which
the Carthaginians asked him; and at this point
of it was more forward to do so than ever, <span class="sidenote">Hiero of
Syracuse.</span>from
a conviction that it was for his interest, with a
view alike to his own sovereignty and to his friendship with
Rome, that Carthage should not perish, and so leave the
superior power to work its own will without resistance. And
his reasoning was entirely sound and prudent. It is never
right to permit such a state of things; nor to help any one to
build up so preponderating a power as to make resistance to
it impossible, however just the cause. Not that the Romans
themselves had failed to observe the obligations
of the treaty, <span class="sidenote">Friendly disposition
of Rome.</span>or were showing any failure of
friendly dispositions; though at first a question
had arisen between the two powers, from the following circumstance.
At the beginning of the war, certain persons
sailing from Italy with provisions for the mutineers, the Carthaginians
captured them and forced them to land in their own
harbour; and presently had as many as five hundred such persons
in their prisons. This caused considerable annoyance at
Rome: but, after sending ambassadors to Carthage and recovering
possession of the men by diplomatic means, the Romans
were so much gratified that, by way of returning the favour,
they restored the prisoners made in the Sicilian war whom they
still retained; and from that time forth responded cheerfully
and generously to all requests made to them. They allowed
their merchants to export to Carthage whatever from time to
time was wanted, and prohibited those who were exporting to
the mutineers. When, subsequently, the mercenaries in
Sardinia, having revolted from Carthage, invited their interference
on the island, they did not respond to the invitation; nor when
the people of Utica offered them their submission did they
accept it, but kept strictly to the engagements contained in
the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="b1_84" id="b1_84"><b>84.</b></a> The assistance thus obtained from these allies encouraged
the Carthaginians to maintain their resistance: while
Math&#333;s and Spendius found themselves quite as much in the
position of besieged as in that of besiegers; for Hamilcar&#8217;s
force reduced them to such distress for provisions that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
were at last compelled to raise the siege. However, after a
short interval, they managed to muster the most <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;238.
Hamilcar, with
assistance from
Sicily, surrounds
Math&#333;s and
Spendius.</span>
effective of the mercenaries and Libyans, to the
number in all of fifty thousand, among whom,
besides others, was Zarzas the Libyan, with
his division, and commenced once more to watch
and follow on the flank of Hamilcar&#8217;s march.
Their method was to keep away from the level country, for
fear of the elephants and the cavalry of Nar&aacute;vas; but to seize
in advance of him all points of vantage, whether it were rising
ground or narrow pass. In these operations they showed
themselves quite a match for their opponents in the fury of
their assault and the gallantry of their attempts; but their
ignorance of military tactics frequently placed them at a
disadvantage. It was, in fact, a real and practical illustration
of the difference between scientific and unscientific warfare:
between the art of a general and the mechanical movements
of a soldier. Like a good draught-player, by isolating and
surrounding them, he destroyed large numbers in detail
without coming to a general engagement at all; and in
movements of more importance he cut off many without
resistance by enticing them into ambushes; while he threw
others into utter dismay by suddenly appearing where they
least expected him, sometimes by day and sometimes by night:
and all whom he took alive he threw to the elephants.
Finally, he managed unexpectedly to beleaguer them on
ground highly unfavourable to them and convenient for his
own force; and reduced them to such a pitch of distress that,
neither venturing to risk an engagement nor being able to run
away, because they were entirely surrounded by a trench and
stockade, they were at last compelled by starvation to feed on
each other: a fitting retribution at the hands of Providence for
their violation of all laws human and divine in their conduct
to their enemies. To sally forth to an engagement they did
not dare, for certain defeat stared them in the face, and they
knew what vengeance awaited them if they were taken; and
as to making terms, it never occurred to them to mention it,
they were conscious that they had gone too far for that. They
still hoped for the arrival of relief from Tunes, of which their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
officers assured them, and accordingly shrank from no suffering
however terrible.</p>

<p><a name="b1_85" id="b1_85"><b>85.</b></a> But when they had used up for food the captives in
this horrible manner, and then the bodies of their slaves,
and still no one came to their relief from Tunes, their
sufferings became too dreadful to bear; and the common
soldiers broke out into open threats of violence against
their officers. Thereupon Autaritus, Zarzas, and Spendius
decided to put themselves into the hands of the enemy and
to hold a parley with Hamilcar, and try to make terms.
They accordingly sent a herald and obtained permission for
the despatch of an embassy. It consisted of
ten ambassadors, <span class="sidenote">Spendius and
Autaritus fall into
the hands of
Hamilcar.</span>who, on their arrival at the
Carthaginian camp, concluded an agreement
with Hamilcar on these terms: &#8220;The Carthaginians
may select any ten men they choose from the enemy,
and allow the rest to depart with one tunic a-piece.&#8221; No
sooner had these terms been agreed to, than Hamilcar said at
once that he selected, according to the terms of the agreement,
the ten ambassadors themselves. The Carthaginians thus got
possession of Autaritus, Spendius, and the other most conspicuous
officers. The Libyans saw that their officers were arrested,
and not knowing the terms of the treaty, believed that some
perfidy was being practised against them, and accordingly flew
to seize their arms. Hamilcar thereupon surrounded them
with his elephants and his entire force, and destroyed them to
a man. This slaughter, by which more than forty thousand
perished, took place near a place called the Saw, so named from
its shape resembling that tool.</p>

<p><a name="b1_86" id="b1_86"><b>86.</b></a> This achievement of Hamilcar revived the hopes of
the Carthaginians who had been in absolute despair:
while he, in conjunction with Nar&aacute;vas
and Hannibal, <span class="sidenote">Siege of Math&#333;s
in Tunes.</span>employed himself in traversing
the country and visiting the cities. His victory secured the
submission of the Libyans; and when they had come in, and
the greater number of the towns had been reduced to
obedience, he and his colleagues advanced to attack Tunes,
and commenced besieging Math&#333;s. Hannibal pitched his
camp on the side of the town nearest to Carthage, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Hamilcar on the opposite side. When this was done they
brought the captives taken from the army of Spendius and
crucified them in the sight of the enemy. But observing that
Hannibal was conducting his command with
negligence and over-confidence, <span class="sidenote">Defeat and death
of Hannibal.</span>Math&#333;s assaulted
the ramparts, killed many of the Carthaginians,
and drove the entire army from the camp. All the
baggage fell into the hands of the enemy, and Hannibal himself
was made a prisoner. They at once took him up to the
cross on which Spendius was hanging, and after the infliction
of exquisite tortures, took down the latter&#8217;s body and fastened
Hannibal, still living, to his cross; and then slaughtered thirty
Carthaginians of the highest rank round the corpse of Spendius.
It seemed as though Fortune designed a competition in cruelty,
giving either side alternately the opportunity of outdoing the
other in mutual vengeance. Owing to the distance of the two
camps from each other it was late before Barcas discovered
the attack made from the town; nor, when he had discovered it,
could he even then go to the rescue with the necessary speed,
because the intervening country was rugged and difficult. He
therefore broke up his camp, and leaving Tunes marched
down the bank of the river Macaras, and pitched his camp
close to its mouth and to the sea.</p>

<p><a name="b1_87" id="b1_87"><b>87.</b></a> This unexpected reverse reduced the Carthaginians
once more to a melancholy state of despair. <span class="sidenote">By a final effort
the Carthaginians
raise a reinforcement
for
Hamilcar.</span>
But though their recent elation of spirit was followed
so closely by this depression, they did not
fail to do what they could for their own preservation.
They selected thirty members of
the Senate; with them they associated Hanno, who had some
time ago been recalled; and, arming all that were left of
military age in the city, despatched them to Barcas, with the
feeling that they were now making their supreme effort. They
strictly charged the members of the Senate to use every effort
to reconcile the two generals Hamilcar and Hanno, and to
make them forget their old quarrel and act harmoniously, in
view of the imminence of the danger. Accordingly, after the
employment of many various arguments, they induced the
generals to meet; and Hanno and Barcas were compelled to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
give in and yield to their representations. The result was
that they ever afterwards co-operated with each other so cordially,
that Math&#333;s found himself continually worsted in the
numerous skirmishes which took place round the town called
Leptis, as well as certain other towns; and at last became
eager to bring the matter to the decision of a general engagement,
a desire in which the Carthaginians also shared in an
equal degree. Both sides therefore having determined upon
this course: they summoned all their allies to join them in confronting
the peril, and collected the garrisons stationed in the
various towns, conscious that they were about to stake their all
on the hazard. All being ready on either side for the conflict,
they gave each other battle by mutual consent, <span class="sidenote">Math&#333;s beaten
and captured.</span>
both sides being drawn up in full military
array. When victory declared itself on the
side of the Carthaginians, the larger number of the Libyans
perished on the field; and the rest, having escaped to a certain
town, surrendered shortly afterwards; while Math&#333;s himself
was taken prisoner by his enemies.</p>

<p><a name="b1_88" id="b1_88"><b>88.</b></a> Most places in Libya submitted to Carthage after this
battle. But the towns of Hippo and Utica still
held out, <span class="sidenote">Reduction of
Hippo and Utica,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;238.</span>feeling that they had no reasonable
grounds for obtaining terms, because their
original acts of hostility left them no place for mercy or
pardon. So true is it that even in such outbreaks, however
criminal in themselves, it is of inestimable advantage to
be moderate, and to refrain from wanton acts which commit
their perpetrator beyond all power of forgiveness. Nor did
their attitude of defiance help these cities. Hanno invested
one and Barcas the other, and quickly reduced them to accept
whatever terms the Carthaginians might determine.</p>

<p>The war with the Libyans had indeed reduced Carthage to
dreadful danger; but its termination enabled her not only to
re-establish her authority over Libya, but also to inflict condign
punishment upon the authors of the revolt. For the last
act in the drama was performed by the young men conducting
a triumphal procession through the town, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;241-238.</span>and
finally inflicting every kind of torture upon
Math&#333;s. For three years and about four months did the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
mercenaries maintain a war against the Carthaginians which
far surpassed any that I ever heard of for cruelty and inhumanity.</p>

<p>And about the same time the Romans took in hand a
naval expedition to Sardinia upon the request
of the mercenaries who had deserted from
that island and come to Italy; <span class="sidenote">The Romans
interfere in
Sardinia.</span>and when
the Carthaginians expressed indignation at this, on the
ground that the lordship over Sardinia more properly belonged
to them, and were preparing to take measures against
those who caused the revolt of the island, the Romans voted
to declare war against them, on the pretence that they were
making warlike preparations, not against Sardinia, but against
themselves. The Carthaginians, however, having just had an
almost miraculous escape from annihilation in the recent war,
were in every respect disabled from renewing their quarrel with
the Romans. They therefore yielded to the necessities of the
hour, and not only abandoned Sardinia, but paid the Romans
twelve hundred talents into the bargain, that they might not
be obliged to undertake the war for the present.</p>

<h2>BOOK II</h2>

<p><a name="b2_1" id="b2_1"><b>1.</b></a> <span class="smcap">In</span> the previous book I have described how the Romans,
having subdued all Italy, began to aim at foreign
dominion; <span class="sidenote">Recapitulation of
the subjects
treated in
Book I.</span>how they crossed to Sicily, and the
reasons of the war which they entered into
against the Carthaginians for the possession of
that island. Next I stated at what period they began the
formation of a navy; and what befell both the one side and
the other up to the end of the war; the consequence of which
was that the Carthaginians entirely evacuated Sicily, and the
Romans took possession of the whole island, except such parts
as were still under the rule of Hiero. Following these events
I endeavoured to describe how the mutiny of the mercenaries
against Carthage, in what is called the Libyan War, burst out;
the lengths to which the shocking outrages in it went; its surprises
and extraordinary incidents, until its conclusion, and the
final triumph of Carthage. I must now relate the events which
immediately succeeded these, touching summarily upon each
in accordance with my original plan.</p>

<p>As soon as they had brought the Libyan war to a conclusion
the Carthaginian government collected an army <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;238,
Hamilcar and
his son Hannibal
sent to Spain.</span>
and despatched it under the command of Hamilcar
to Iberia. This general took over the command
of the troops, and with his son Hannibal,
then nine years old, crossing by the Pillars of Hercules, set
about recovering the Carthaginian possessions in Iberia. He
spent nine years in Iberia, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;238-229.</span>and after reducing
many Iberian tribes by war or diplomacy to
obedience to Carthage he died in a manner worthy of his
great achievements; for he lost his life in a battle against the
most warlike and powerful tribes, in which he showed a conspicuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
and even reckless personal gallantry. The Carthaginians
appointed his son-in-law Hasdrubal to succeed him, who
was at the time in command of the fleet.</p>

<p><a name="b2_2" id="b2_2"><b>2.</b></a> It was at this same period that the Romans for the first
time crossed to Illyricum and that part of <span class="sidenote">Illyricum.</span>
Europe with an army. The history of this expedition
must not be treated as immaterial; but must be carefully
studied by those who wish to understand clearly the
story I have undertaken to tell, and to trace the progress and
consolidation of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Agron, king of the Illyrians, was the son of Pleuratus, and
possessed the most powerful force, both by
land and sea, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;233-232.</span>
of any of the kings who had
reigned in Illyria before him. By a bribe received from
Demetrius he was induced to promise help to the Medionians,
who were at that time being besieged by the
Aetolians, <span class="sidenote">Siege of Medion
in Acarnania.</span>
who, being unable to persuade the
Medionians to join their league, had determined
to reduce the city by force. They accordingly levied their
full army, pitched their camp under the walls of the city, and
kept up a continuous blockade, using every means to force
their way in, and every kind of siege-machine. But when
the time of the annual election of their Strategus drew near,
the besieged being now in great distress, and seeming likely
every day to surrender, the existing Strategus made an appeal
to the Aetolians. He argued that as he had had during
his term of office all the suffering and the danger, it was but
fair that when they got possession of the town he should have
the apportioning of the spoil, and the privilege of inscribing his
name on such arms as should be preserved for dedication.
This was resisted by some, and especially by those who were
candidates for the office, who urged upon the Assembly not to
prejudge this matter, but to leave it open for fortune to determine
who was to be invested with this honour; and, finally, the
Aetolians decided that whoever was general when the city was
taken should share the apportioning of the spoils, and the
honour of inscribing the arms, with his predecessor.</p>

<p><a name="b2_3" id="b2_3"><b>3.</b></a> The decision was come to on the day before the election
of a new Strategus, and the transference of the command had,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
according to the Aetolian custom, to take place. But on
that very night a hundred galleys with five
thousand Illyrians on board, <span class="sidenote">The Illyrians
relieve Medion.</span>sailed up to land
near Medion. Having dropped anchor at
daybreak, they effected a disembarkation with secrecy and
despatch; they then formed in the order customary in their
country, and advanced in their several companies against the
Aetolian lines. These last were overwhelmed with astonishment
at the unexpected nature and boldness of the move; but
they had long been inspired with overweening self-confidence,
and having full reliance in their own forces were far from being
dismayed. They drew up the greater part of their hoplites
and cavalry in front of their lines on the level ground, and
with a portion of their cavalry and their light infantry they
hastened to occupy some rising ground in front of their camp,
which nature had made easily defensible. A single charge,
however, of the Illyrians, whose numbers and close order gave
them irresistible weight, served to dislodge the light-armed
troops, and forced the cavalry who were on the ground with
them to retire to the hoplites. But the Illyrians, being on the
higher ground, and charging down from it upon the Aetolian
troops formed up on the plain, routed them without difficulty; the
Medionians at the same time making a diversion in their favour
by sallying out of the town and charging the Aetolians. Thus,
after killing a great number, and taking a still greater number
prisoners, and becoming masters also of their arms and
baggage, the Illyrians, having carried out the orders of their
king, conveyed their baggage and the rest of the booty to their
boats, and immediately set sail for their own country.</p>

<p><a name="b2_4" id="b2_4"><b>4.</b></a> This was a most unexpected relief to the Medionians.
They met in public assembly and deliberated on the whole
business, and especially as to the inscribing the arms reserved
for dedication. They decided, in mockery of the Aetolian
decree, that the inscription should contain the name of the
Aetolian commander on the day of battle, and of the candidates
for succession to his office. And indeed Fortune seems, in what
happened to them, to have designed a display of her power to
the rest of mankind. The very thing which these men were
in momentary expectation of undergoing at the hands of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
enemies, she put it in their power to inflict upon those
enemies, and all within a very brief interval. The unexpected
disaster of the Aetolians, too, may teach all the world not to
calculate on the future as though it were the actually existent,
and not to reckon securely on what may still turn out quite
otherwise, but to allow a certain margin to the unexpected.
And as this is true everywhere and to every man, so is it
especially true in war.</p>

<p>When his galleys returned, and he heard from his officers
the events of the expedition, <span class="sidenote">Death of Agron,
who is succeeded
by his wife Teuta,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;231.</span>
King Agron was
so beside himself with joy at the idea of having
conquered the Aetolians, whose confidence in
their own prowess had been extreme, that, giving
himself over to excessive drinking and other similar indulgences,
he was attacked by a pleurisy of which in a few days he died.
His wife Teuta succeeded him on the throne; and managed
the various details of administration by means of friends whom
she could trust. But her woman&#8217;s head had been turned by
the success just related, and she fixed her gaze upon that, and
had no eyes for anything going on outside the country. Her
first measure was to grant letters of marque to privateers,
authorising them to plunder all whom they fell in with; and
she next collected a fleet and military force as large as the
former one, and despatched them with general instructions to
the leaders to regard every land as belonging to an enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b2_5" id="b2_5"><b>5.</b></a> Their first attack was to be upon the coast of Elis and
Messenia, which had been from time immemorial
the scene of the raids of the Illyrians. <span class="sidenote">Teuta&#8217;s piratical
fleet,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;230.</span>
For owing to the length of their seaboard, and
to the fact that their most powerful cities were inland, troops
raised to resist them had a great way to go, and were long in
coming to the spot where the Illyrian pirates landed; who accordingly
overran those districts, and swept them clean without
having anything to fear. However, when this fleet was off
Phoenice in Epirus they landed to get supplies. <span class="sidenote">Takes Phoenice
in Epirus.</span>There they
fell in with some Gauls, who to the number of
eight hundred were stationed at Phoenice, being
in the pay of the Epirotes; and contracted with
them to betray the town into their hands. Having made this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
bargain, they disembarked and took the town and everything
in it at the first blow, the Gauls within the walls acting in
collusion with them. When this news was known, the
Epirotes raised a general levy and came in haste to the
rescue. Arriving in the neighbourhood of Phoenice, they
pitched their camp so as to have the river which flows
past Phoenice between them and the enemy, tearing up
the planks of the bridge over it for security. But news
being brought them that Scerdilaidas with five thousand
Illyrians was marching overland by way of the pass near
Antigoneia, they detached some of their forces to guard that
town; while the main body gave themselves over to an
unrestrained indulgence in all the luxuries which the country
could supply; and among other signs of demoralisation they
neglected the necessary precaution of posting sentries and
night pickets. The division of their forces, as well as the
careless conduct of the remainder, did not escape the observation
of the Illyrians; who, sallying out at night, and replacing the
planks on the bridge, crossed the river safely, and having
secured a strong position, remained there quietly for the rest
of the night. At daybreak both armies drew up their forces
in front of the town and engaged. In this battle the Epirotes
were decidedly worsted: a large number of them fell, still
more were taken prisoners, and the rest fled in the direction
of the country of the Atintanes.</p>

<p><a name="b2_6" id="b2_6"><b>6.</b></a> Having met with this reverse, and having lost all the
hopes which they had cherished, <span class="sidenote">The Aetolian and
Achaean leagues

the relief of the
Epirotes. A truce
is made. The
Illyrians depart.</span>the Epirotes
turned to the despatch of ambassadors to the
Aetolians and Achaeans, earnestly begging for
their assistance. Moved by pity for their misfortunes,
these nations consented; and an army
of relief sent out by them arrived at Helicranum.
Meanwhile the Illyrians who had occupied Phoenice, having
effected a junction with Scerdilaidas, advanced with him to this
place, and, taking up a position opposite to this army of relief,
wished at first to give it battle. But they were embarrassed
by the unfavourable nature of the ground; and just then a
despatch was received from Teuta, ordering their instant
return, because certain Illyrians had revolted to the Dardani<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>.
Accordingly, after merely stopping to plunder Epirus, they made
a truce with the inhabitants, by which they undertook to deliver
up all freemen, and the city of Phoenice, for a fixed ransom.
They then took the slaves they had captured and the rest of
their booty to their galleys, and some of them sailed away;
while those who were with Scerdilaidas retired by land through
the pass at Antigoneia, after inspiring no small or ordinary terror
in the minds of the Greeks who lived along the coast. For
seeing the most securely placed and powerful city of Epirus
thus unexpectedly reduced to slavery, they one and all began
henceforth to feel anxious, not merely as in former times for
their property in the open country, but for the safety of their
own persons and cities.</p>

<p>The Epirotes were thus unexpectedly preserved: but so far
from trying to retaliate on those who had wronged them, or expressing
gratitude to those who had come to their relief, they
sent ambassadors in conjunction with the Acarnanians to
Queen Teuta, and made a treaty with the Illyrians, in virtue
of which they engaged henceforth to co-operate with them and
against the Achaean and Aetolian leagues. All which proceedings
showed conclusively the levity of their conduct towards
men who had stood their friends, as well as an originally short-sighted
policy in regard to their own interests.</p>

<p><a name="b2_7" id="b2_7"><b>7.</b></a> That men, in the infirmity of human nature, should fall
into misfortunes which defy calculation, is the fault not of the
sufferers but of Fortune, and of those who do the wrong; but
that they should from mere levity, and with their eyes open,
thrust themselves upon the most serious disasters is without
dispute the fault of the victims themselves. Therefore it is
that pity and sympathy and assistance await those whose
failure is due to Fortune: reproach and rebuke from all men
of sense those who have only their own folly to thank for it.</p>

<p>It is the latter that the Epirotes now richly deserved at the
hands of the Greeks. For in the first place, who in his senses,
knowing the common report as to the character of the Gauls,
would not have hesitated to trust to them a
city so rich, <span class="sidenote">The career of a
body of Gallic
mercenaries,</span> and offering so many opportunities
for treason? And again, who would not
have been on his guard against the bad character of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
particular body of them? For they had originally been
driven from their native country by an outburst of popular
indignation at an act of treachery done by them to their
own kinsfolk and relations. Then having been received
by the Carthaginians, because of the exigencies of the war
in which the latter were engaged, <span class="sidenote">at Agrigentum,</span> and being
drafted into Agrigentum to garrison it (being at
the time more than three thousand strong), they seized the
opportunity of a dispute as to pay, arising between the soldiers
and their generals, to plunder the city; and again being brought
by the Carthaginians into Eryx to perform the
same duty, <span class="sidenote">at Eryx.</span>
they first endeavoured to betray the
city and those who were shut up in it with them to the
Romans who were besieging it; and when they failed in that
treason, they deserted in a body to the enemy: whose trust
they also betrayed by plundering the temple of Aphrodite in
Eryx. Thoroughly convinced, therefore, of their abominable
character, as soon as they had made peace with Carthage the
Romans made it their first business to disarm them, put them
on board ship, and forbid them ever to enter
any part of Italy. <span class="sidenote">Disarmed by the
Romans.</span>
These were the men whom the Epirotes made the protectors of their democracy
and the guardians of their laws! To such men as these they
entrusted their most wealthy city! How then can it be denied
that they were the cause of their own misfortunes?</p>

<p>My object, in commenting on the blind folly of the
Epirotes, is to point out that it is never wise to introduce a
foreign garrison, especially of barbarians, which is too strong
to be controlled.</p>

<p><a name="b2_8" id="b2_8"><b>8.</b></a> To return to the Illyrians. From time immemorial
they had oppressed and pillaged vessels sailing
from Italy: <span class="sidenote">Illyrian pirates.</span>and now while their fleet was engaged
at Phoenice a considerable number of them, separating
from the main body, committed acts of piracy on a
number of Italian merchants: some they merely plundered, <span class="sidenote">The Romans interfere,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;230.</span>
others they murdered, and a great many they
carried off alive into captivity. Now, though
complaints against the Illyrians had reached the
Roman government in times past, they had always been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
neglected; but now when more and more persons approached
the Senate on this subject, they appointed two ambassadors,
Gaius and Lucius Coruncanius, to go to Illyricum and investigate
the matter. But on the arrival of her galleys from
Epirus, the enormous quantity and beauty of the spoils which
they brought home (for Phoenice was by far the wealthiest
city in Epirus at that time), so fired the imagination of Queen
Teuta, that she was doubly eager to carry on the predatory
warfare on the coasts of Greece. At the moment, however,
she was stopped by the rebellion at home; but it had not
taken her long to put down the revolt in Illyria, and she was
engaged in besieging Issa, the last town which held out, when
just at that very time the Roman ambassadors arrived. A
time was fixed for their audience, and they proceeded to discuss
the injuries which their citizens had sustained. <span class="sidenote">Queen Teuta&#8217;s
reception of the
Roman legates.</span>
Throughout the interview, however,
Teuta listened with an insolent and disdainful
air; and when they had finished their speech, she replied that
she would endeavour to take care that no injury should be
inflicted on Roman citizens by Illyrian officials; but that it was
not the custom for the sovereigns of Illyria to hinder private
persons from taking booty at sea. Angered by these words,
the younger of the two ambassadors used a plainness of speech
which, though thoroughly to the point, was rather ill-timed.
&#8220;The Romans,&#8221; he said, &#8220;O Teuta, have a most excellent
custom of using the State for the punishment of private
wrongs and the redress of private grievances: and we will
endeavour, God willing, before long to compel you to improve
the relations between the sovereign and the subject in
Illyria.&#8221; The queen received this plain speaking with womanish
passion and unreasoning anger. So enraged was she at the
speech that, <span class="sidenote">A Roman legate
assassinated.</span>in despite of the conventions universally observed
among mankind, she despatched some men after
the ambassadors, as they were sailing home, to
kill the one who had used this plainness. Upon
this being reported at Rome the people were highly incensed
at the queen&#8217;s violation of the law of nations, and at once set
about preparations for war, enrolling legions and collecting a
fleet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b2_9" id="b2_9"><b>9.</b></a> When the season for sailing was come Teuta sent out a
larger fleet of galleys than ever against the
Greek shores, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;229.
Another piratical
fleet sent out by
Teuta.</span>some of which sailed straight to
Corcyra; while a portion of them put into the
harbour of Epidamnus on the pretext of taking
in victual and water, but really to attack the town. <span class="sidenote">Their treacherous
attack on Epidamnus,
which is

The
Epidamnians received them without suspicion
and without taking any precautions. Entering
the town therefore clothed merely in their
tunics, as though they were only come to fetch
water, but with swords concealed in the water vessels, they
slew the guards stationed at the gates, and in a brief space were
masters of the gate-tower. Being energetically supported by
a reinforcement from the ships, which came quickly up in
accordance with a pre-arrangement, they got possession of the
greater part of the walls without difficulty. But though the
citizens were taken off their guard they made a determined
and desperate resistance, and the Illyrians after maintaining
their ground for some time were eventually driven out of
the town. So the Epidamnians on this occasion went near to
lose their city by their carelessness; but by the courage which
they displayed they saved themselves from actual damage
while receiving a useful lesson for the future. The Illyrians
who had engaged in this enterprise made haste to put to sea, <span class="sidenote">Attack on Corcyra.</span>
and, rejoining the advanced squadron, put in at
Corcyra: there, to the terror of the inhabitants,
they disembarked and set about besieging the
town. Dismayed and despairing of their safety, the Corcyreans, <span class="sidenote">The Corcyreans
appeal to the
Aetolian and
Achaean leagues.</span>
acting in conjunction with the people of Apollonia
and Epidamnus, sent off envoys to the
Achaean and Aetolian leagues, begging for instant
help, and entreating them not to allow of
their being deprived of their homes by the Illyrians. The
petition was accepted, and the Achaean and Aetolian leagues
combined to send aid. The ten decked ships of war belonging
to the Achaeans were manned, and having been fitted out in a
few days, set sail for Corcyra in hopes of raising the siege.</p>

<p><a name="b2_10" id="b2_10"><b>10.</b></a> But the Illyrians obtained a reinforcement of seven
decked ships from the Acarnanians, in virtue of their treaty with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
that people, and, putting to sea, engaged the Achaean fleet off
the islands called Paxi. The Acarnanian and Achaean ships
fought without victory declaring for either, <span class="sidenote">Defeat of the
Achaean ships.</span>
and
without receiving any further damage than
having some of their crew wounded. But the
Illyrians lashed their galleys four together, and, caring nothing
for any damage that might happen to them, grappled with the
enemy by throwing their galleys athwart their prows and encouraging
them to charge; when the enemies&#8217; prows struck
them, and got entangled by the lashed-together galleys
getting hitched on to their forward gear, the Illyrians leaped
upon the decks of the Achaean ships and captured them
by the superior number of their armed men. In this way
they took four triremes, and sunk one quinquereme with
all hands, on board of which Margos of Caryneia was sailing,
who had all his life served the Achaean league with complete
integrity. The vessels engaged with the Acarnanians, seeing
the triumphant success of the Illyrians, and trusting to their
own speed, hoisted their sails to the wind and effected their
voyage home without further disaster. The Illyrians, on the
other hand, filled with self-confidence by their success, continued
their siege of the town in high spirits, and without
putting themselves to any unnecessary trouble; <span class="sidenote">Corcyra submits.</span>while the
Corcyreans, reduced to despair of safety by
what had happened, after sustaining the siege
for a short time longer, made terms with the Illyrians, consenting
to receive a garrison, and with it Demetrius of Pharos.
After this had been settled, the Illyrian admirals put to sea
again; and, having arrived at Epidamnus, once more set about
besieging that town.</p>

<p><a name="b2_11" id="b2_11"><b>11.</b></a> In this same season one of the Consuls, Gnaeus
Fulvius, started from Rome with two hundred
ships, and the other Consul, Aulus Postumius, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;229.
The Roman Consuls,

and army, start

with the land forces. The plan of Gnaeus was
to sail direct to Corcyra, because he supposed
that he should find the result of the siege still
undecided. But when he found that he was too
late for that, he determined nevertheless to sail to the island
because he wished to know the exact facts as to what had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
happened there, and to test the sincerity of the overtures that
had been made by Demetrius. For Demetrius, <span class="sidenote">Demetrius of Pharos.</span>
being in disgrace with Teuta, and afraid of what
she might do to him, had been sending messages
to Rome, offering to put the city and everything else of which
he was in charge into their hands. Delighted at the appearance
of the Romans, the Corcyreans not only surrendered the garrison
to them, with the consent of Demetrius, <span class="sidenote">Corcyra becomes a &#8220;friend of Rome.&#8221;</span>but committed
themselves also unconditionally to the Roman
protection; believing that this was their only
security in the future against the piratical incursions
of the Illyrians. So the Romans, having admitted
the Corcyreans into the number of the friends of Rome,
sailed for Apollonia, with Demetrius to act as their guide for
the rest of the campaign. At the same time
the other Consul,
<span class="sidenote">Aulus Postumius.</span>Aulus Postumius, conveyed
his army across from Brundisium, consisting of twenty
thousand infantry and about two thousand horse. This
army, as well as the fleet under Gnaeus Fulvius, being
directed upon Apollonia, which at once put itself under
Roman protection, both forces were again put in motion
on news being brought that Epidamnus was being besieged
by the enemy. No sooner did the Illyrians learn the
approach of the Romans than they hurriedly broke up the
siege and fled. The Romans, taking the Epidamnians under
their protection, advanced into the interior of
Illyricum, subduing the Ardiaei as they went. <span class="sidenote">The Roman settlement of Illyricum.</span>
They were met on their march by envoys from
many tribes: those of the Partheni offered an unconditional
surrender, as also did those of the Atintanes. Both were
accepted: and the Roman army proceeded towards Issa, which
was being besieged by Illyrian troops. On their arrival, they
forced the enemy to raise the siege, and received the Issaeans
also under their protection. Besides, as the fleet coasted along,
they took certain Illyrian cities by storm; among which was
Nutria, where they lost not only a large number of soldiers,
but some of the Military Tribunes also and the Quaestor.
But they captured twenty of the galleys which were conveying
the plunder from the country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Illyrian troops engaged in blockading Issa, those
that belonged to Pharos were left unharmed, as a favour to
Demetrius; while all the rest scattered and fled to Arbo.
Teuta herself, with a very few attendants, escaped to Rhizon,
a small town very strongly fortified, and situated on the river
of the same name. Having accomplished all this, and having
placed the greater part of Illyria under Demetrius, and invested
him with a wide dominion, the Consuls retired to Epidamnus
with their fleet and army.</p>

<p><a name="b2_12" id="b2_12"><b>12.</b></a> Then Gnaeus Fulvius sailed back to Rome with the
larger part of the naval and military forces, while Postumius,
staying behind and collecting forty vessels and a legion from
the cities in that district, wintered there to guard the Ardiaei
and other tribes that had committed themselves to the protection
of Rome. Just before spring in the
next year, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;228. Teuta submits.</span>
Teuta sent envoys to Rome and concluded
a treaty; in virtue of which she consented
to pay a fixed tribute, and to abandon all Illyricum, with the
exception of some few districts: and what affected Greece more
than anything, she agreed not to sail beyond Lissus with more
than two galleys, and those unarmed. When this arrangement
had been concluded, Postumius sent legates to the Aetolian
and Achaean leagues, who on their arrival first explained the
reasons for the war and the Roman invasion; and then stated
what had been accomplished in it, and read the treaty which
had been made with the Illyrians. The envoys then returned
to Corcyra after receiving the thanks of both leagues: for they
had freed Greece by this treaty from a very serious cause for
alarm, the fact being that the Illyrians were not the enemies
of this or that people, but the common enemies of all alike.</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances of the first armed interference
of the Romans in Illyricum and that part of Europe, and their
first diplomatic relations with Greece; and such too were the
motives which suggested them. But having thus begun, the
Romans immediately afterwards sent envoys to Corinth and
Athens. And it was then that the Corinthians first admitted
Romans to take part in the Isthmian games.</p>

<p><a name="b2_13" id="b2_13"><b>13.</b></a> We must now return to Hasdrubal in Iberia. He had
during this period been conducting his command with ability<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
and success, and had not only given in general a great impulse
to the Carthaginian interests there, but in particular
had greatly strengthened them by the <span class="sidenote">Hasdrubal in

and New Town, the situation of which was
exceedingly convenient for operations in Libya as
well as in Iberia. I shall take a more suitable opportunity of
speaking of the site of this town, and pointing out the advantages
offered by it to both countries: I must at present speak
of the impression made by Hasdrubal&#8217;s policy at Rome.
Seeing him strengthening the Carthaginian influence in Spain,
and rendering it continually more formidable, the Romans
were anxious to interfere in the politics of that country. They
discovered, as they thought, that they had allowed their suspicions
to be lulled to sleep, and had meanwhile given the
Carthaginians the opportunity of consolidating their power.
They did not venture, however, at the moment to impose
conditions or make war on them, because they
were in almost daily dread of an attack from
the Celts. <span class="sidenote">Dread of the
Gauls.</span>They determined therefore to
mollify Hasdrubal by gentle measures, and so to leave themselves
free to attack the Celts first and try conclusions with
them: for they were convinced that, with such enemies on
their flank, they would not only be unable to keep their
hold over the rest of Italy, but even to reckon on safety in
their own city. <span class="sidenote">Treaty with
Hasdrubal.</span>Accordingly, while sending envoys
to Hasdrubal, and making a treaty with him
by which the Carthaginians, without saying anything
of the rest of Iberia, engaged not to cross the Iber

<p><a name="b2_14" id="b2_14"><b>14.</b></a> This war itself I shall treat only summarily, to avoid
breaking the thread of my history; but I must go back somewhat
in point of time, and refer to the period at which these
tribes originally occupied their districts in Italy. For the story
I think is worth knowing for its own sake, and must absolutely
be kept in mind, if we wish to understand what tribes and
districts they were on which Hannibal relied to assist him in
his bold design of destroying the Roman dominion. I will
first describe the country in which they live, its nature, and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
relation to the rest of Italy; for if we clearly understand its
peculiarities, geographical and natural, we shall be better able
to grasp the salient points in the history of the war.</p>

<p>Italy, taken as a whole, is a triangle, of which the eastern
side is bounded by the Ionian Sea and the
Adriatic Gulf, <span class="sidenote">The Geography
of Italy.</span>its southern and western sides by
the Sicilian and Tyrrhenian seas; these two sides
converge to form the apex of the triangle, which is represented
by the southern promontory of Italy called Cocinthus, and
which separates the Ionian from the Sicilian Sea.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The
third side, or base of this triangle, is on the north, and is
formed by the chain of the Alps stretching right across the
country, beginning at Marseilles and the coast of the Sardinian
Sea, and with no break in its continuity until within a short
distance of the head of the Adriatic. To the south of this
range, which I said we must regard as the base of the triangle,
are the most northerly plains of Italy, the largest and most
fertile of any with which I am acquainted in all Europe. This
is the district with which we are at present concerned. Taken
as a whole, it too forms a triangle, the apex of which is the point
where the Apennines and Alps converge, <span class="sidenote">Col di Tenda.</span>above
Marseilles, and not far from the coast of the
Sardinian Sea. The northern side of this triangle is formed
by the Alps, extending for 2200 stades; the southern by the
Apennines, extending 3600; and the base is the seaboard of
the Adriatic, from the town of Sena to the head of the gulf, a
distance of more than 2500 stades. The total length of the
three sides will thus be nearly 10,000 stades.</p>

<p><a name="b2_15" id="b2_15"><b>15.</b></a> The yield of corn in this district is so abundant that
wheat is often sold at four obols a Sicilian
medimnus, <span class="sidenote">Gallia
Cis-Alpina.</span>barley at two, or a metretes of wine
for an equal measure of barley. The quantity
of panic and millet produced is extraordinary; and the amount
of acorns grown in the oak forests scattered about the country
may be gathered from the fact that, though nowhere are more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>pigs slaughtered than in Italy, for sacrifices as well as for family
use, and for feeding the army, by far the most important
supply is from these plains. The cheapness and abundance
of all articles of food may also be clearly shown from the fact
that travellers in these parts, when stopping at inns, do not
bargain for particular articles, but simply ask what the charge is
per head for board. And for the most part the innkeepers are
content to supply their guests with every necessary at a charge
rarely exceeding half an as (that is, the fourth part of an obol)<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>
a day each. Of the numbers, stature, and personal beauty of
the inhabitants, and still more of their bravery in war, we shall
be able to satisfy ourselves from the facts of their history.</p>

<p><a name="b2_16" id="b2_16"><b>16.</b></a> Such parts of both slopes of the Alps as are not too
rocky or too precipitous are inhabited by different
tribes; those on the north towards the
Rhone by the Gauls, <span class="sidenote">The Alps.</span>called Transalpine; those towards the
Italian plains by the Taurisci and Agones and a number of
other barbarous tribes. The name Transalpine is not tribal,
but local, from the Latin proposition <i>trans</i>, &#8220;across.&#8221; The
summits of the Alps, from their rugged character, and the
great depth of eternal snow, are entirely uninhabited. Both
slopes of the Apennines, <span class="sidenote">The Apennines.</span>
towards the Tuscan
Sea and towards the plains, are inhabited by
the Ligurians, from above Marseilles and the junction with the
Alps to Pisae on the coast, the first city on the west of Etruria,
and inland to Arretium. Next to them come the Etruscans; and
next on both slopes the Umbrians. The distance between the
Apennines and the Adriatic averages about five hundred stades;
and when it leaves the northern plains the chain verges to the
right, and goes entirely through the middle of the rest of Italy, as
far as the Sicilian Sea. The remaining portion of this triangle,
namely the plain along the sea coast, extends as far as the town
of Sena. The Padus, celebrated by the poets under the name
of Eridanus, <span class="sidenote">The Po.</span>rises in the Alps near the apex
of the triangle, and flows down to the plains
with a southerly course; but after reaching the plains, it
turns to the east, and flowing through them discharges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
itself by two mouths into the Adriatic. The larger part
of the plain is thus cut off by it, and lies between this river
and the Alps to the head of the Adriatic. In body of water
it is second to no river in Italy, because the mountain
streams, descending from the Alps and Apennines to the plain,
one and all flow into it on both sides; and its stream is at its
height and beauty about the time of the rising of the Dog
Star, <span class="sidenote">15th July.</span>
because it is then swollen by the melting
snows on those mountains. It is navigable for
nearly two thousand stades up stream, the ships entering by
the mouth called Olana; for though it is a single main stream
to begin with, it branches off into two at the place called
Trigoboli, of which streams the northern is called the Padoa,
the southern the Olana. At the mouth of the latter there is
a harbour affording as safe anchorage as any in the Adriatic.
The whole river is called by the country folk the Bodencus.
As to the other stories current in Greece about this river,&mdash;I
mean Phaethon and his fall, and the tears of the poplars and
the black clothes of the inhabitants along this stream, which
they are said to wear at this day as mourning for Phaethon,&mdash;all
such tragic incidents I omit for the present, as not being suitable
to the kind of work I have in hand; but I shall return to them
at some other more fitting opportunity, particularly because

<p><a name="b2_17" id="b2_17"><b>17.</b></a> To continue my description. These plains were
anciently inhabited by Etruscans,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> at the same
period as what are called the Phlegraean plains

however,
have enjoyed the highest reputation, because
they lay in a great many people&#8217;s way and so got known.
In speaking then of the history of the Etruscan Empire,
we should not refer to the district occupied by them at the
present time, but to these northern plains, and to what they
did when they inhabited them. Their chief intercourse was
with the Celts, because they occupied the adjoining districts;
who, envying the beauty of their lands, seized some slight
pretext to gather a great host and expel the Etruscans from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the valley of the Padus, which they at once took possession
of themselves. First, the country near the source of the
Padus was occupied by the Laevi and Lebecii; after them the
Insubres settled in the country, the largest tribe of all; and
next them, along the bank of the river, the Cenomani. But
the district along the shore of the Adriatic was held by another
very ancient tribe called Ven&#277;ti, in customs and dress nearly
allied to Celts, but using quite a different language, about
whom the tragic poets have written a great many wonderful
tales. South of the Padus, in the Apennine district, first
beginning from the west, the Ananes, and next them the Boii
settled. Next them, on the coast of the Adriatic, the Lingones;
and south of these, still on the sea-coast, the Senones. These
are the most important tribes that took possession
of this part of the country. <span class="sidenote">Their character.</span>They lived
in open villages, and without any permanent buildings. As
they made their beds of straw or leaves, and fed on meat,
and followed no pursuits but those of war and agriculture,
they lived simple lives without being acquainted with any
science or art whatever. Each man&#8217;s property, moreover,
consisted in cattle and gold; as they were the only things
that could be easily carried with them, when they wandered
from place to place, and changed their dwelling as their
fancy directed. They made a great point, however, of friendship:
for the man who had the largest number of clients or
companions in his wanderings, was looked upon as the most
formidable and powerful member of the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p><a name="b2_18" id="b2_18"><b>18.</b></a> In the early times of their settlement they did not
merely subdue the territory which they occupied, but rendered
also many of the neighbouring peoples subject to them, whom
they overawed by their audacity. Some time afterwards they
conquered the Romans in battle, and pursuing the flying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
legions, in three days after the battle occupied Rome itself
with the exception of the Capitol. But a circumstance
intervened which recalled them home, <span class="sidenote">Battle of the
Allia, 18th July,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;390.</span>
an invasion, that is to say, of their territory by
the Ven&#277;ti. Accordingly they made terms with the Romans,
handed back the city, and returned to their own land; and
subsequently were occupied with domestic wars. Some of the
tribes, also, who dwelt on the Alps, comparing their own barren
districts with the rich territory occupied by the others, were continually
making raids upon them, and collecting their forces
to attack them. <span class="sidenote">Latin war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;349-340.</span>
This gave the Romans time
to recover their strength, and to come to terms
with the people of Latium. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;360.</span>When, thirty
years after the capture of the city, the Celts came again as far
as Alba, the Romans were taken by surprise; and <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;348.</span>
having had no intelligence of the intended invasion,
nor time to collect the forces of the Socii, did not
venture to give them battle. But when another invasion in
great force took place twelve years later, they
did get previous intelligence of it; and, having
mustered their allies, sallied forth to meet them with great
spirit, being eager to engage them and fight a decisive battle.
But the Gauls were dismayed at their approach; and, being
besides weakened by internal feuds, retreated homewards as
soon as night fell, with all the appearance of a regular flight. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;334.</span>
After this alarm they kept quiet for thirteen
years; at the end of which period, seeing
that the power of the Romans was growing formidable, they
made a peace and a definite treaty with them.</p>

<p><a name="b2_19" id="b2_19"><b>19.</b></a> They abided by this treaty for thirty years: but at that
time, alarmed by a threatening movement on the part of the
Transalpine tribes, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;299.</span>and fearing that a dangerous war was
imminent, they diverted the attack of the invading
horde from themselves by presents and
appeals to their ties of kindred, but incited them to attack the
Romans, joining in the expedition themselves. They directed
their march through Etruria, and were joined by the Etruscans;
and the combined armies, after taking a great quantity of booty,
got safely back from the Roman territory. But when they got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
home, they quarrelled about the division of the spoil, and in
the end destroyed most of it, as well as the flower of their own
force. This is the way of the Gauls when they have appropriated
their neighbours&#8217; property; and it mostly arises from
brutal drunkenness, and intemperate feeding. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;297.</span>
In the fourth year after this, the Samnites
and Gauls made a league, gave the Romans battle in the
neighbourhood of Camerium, and slew a large number.
Incensed at this defeat, the Romans marched out a few days
afterwards, and with two Consular armies engaged the enemy in
the territory of Sentinum; and, having killed the greater number
of them, forced the survivors to retreat in hot haste each
to his own land. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;283.</span>Again, after another interval
of ten years, the Gauls besieged Arretium with
a great army, and the Romans went to the assistance of the
town, and were beaten in an engagement under its walls.
The Praetor Lucius<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> having fallen in this battle, Manius
Curius was appointed in his place. The ambassadors, sent
by him to the Gauls to treat for the prisoners, were treacherously
murdered by them. At this the Romans, in high wrath, sent
an expedition against them, which was met by the tribe called
the Senones. In a pitched battle the army of the Senones were
cut to pieces, and the rest of the tribe expelled from the country;
into which the Romans sent the first colony which they ever
planted in Gaul&mdash;namely, <span class="sidenote">Sena Gallica.</span>the town of Sena, so
called from the tribe of Gauls which formerly
occupied it. This is the town which I mentioned before as
lying on the coast at the extremity of the plains of the Padus.</p>

<p><a name="b2_20" id="b2_20"><b>20.</b></a> Seeing the expulsion of the Senones, and fearing the
same fate for themselves, the Boii made a general levy, summoned
the Etruscans to join them, and set out to war. They
mustered their forces near the lacus Vadimonis, and there gave
the Romans battle; in which the Etruscans indeed suffered a loss
of more than half their men, while scarcely any of
the Boii escaped. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;282.</span>But yet in the very next year
the same two nations joined forces once more; and arming even
those of them who had only just reached manhood, gave the
Romans battle again; and it was not until they had been utterly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>defeated in this engagement that they humbled themselves so
far as to send ambassadors to Rome and make a treaty.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>These events took place in the third year before Pyrrhus
crossed into Italy, and in the fifth before the destruction of the
Gauls at Delphi. For at this period fortune seems to have
plagued the Gauls with a kind of epidemic of war. But the
Romans gained two most important advantages from these
events. First, their constant defeats at the hands of the Gauls
had inured them to the worst that could befall them; and so,
when they had to fight with Pyrrhus, they came to the contest
like trained and experienced gladiators. And in the second
place, they had crushed the insolence of the Gauls just in time
to allow them to give an undivided attention, first to the war
with Pyrrhus for the possession of Italy, and then to the war
with Carthage for the supremacy in Sicily.</p>

<p><a name="b2_21" id="b2_21"><b>21.</b></a> After these defeats the Gauls maintained an unbroken
peace with Rome for forty-five years. But when the generation
which had witnessed the actual struggle had passed away,
and a younger generation of men had taken their places, filled
with unreflecting hardihood, and who had neither experienced
nor seen any suffering or reverse, they began, as was natural, to
disturb the settlement; <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;236.</span>and on the one hand
to let trifling causes exasperate them against
Rome, and on the other to invite the Alpine Gauls to join the
fray. At first these intrigues were carried on by their chiefs
without the knowledge of the tribesmen; and accordingly,
when an armed host of Transalpine Gauls arrived at Ariminum,
the Boii were suspicious; and forming a conspiracy against their
own leaders, as well as against the new-comers, they put their
own two kings Atis and Galatus to death, and cut each other
to pieces in a pitched battle. Just then the Romans, alarmed
at the threatened invasion, had despatched an army; but learning
that the Gauls had committed this act of self-destruction, it
returned home again. In the fifth year after this alarm, in
the Consulship of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, the Romans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
divided among their citizens the territory of Picenum, from
which they had ejected the Senones when they
conquered them: <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;232.</span>a democratic measure introduced
by Gaius Flaminius, and a policy which we must
pronounce to have been the first step in the demoralisation of
the people, as well as the cause of the next Gallic war. For
many of the Gauls, and especially the Boii whose lands were
coterminous with the Roman territory, entered upon that war
from the conviction that the object of Rome in her wars with
them was no longer supremacy and empire over them, but
their total expulsion and destruction.</p>

<p><a name="b2_22" id="b2_22"><b>22.</b></a> Accordingly the two most extensive tribes, the Insubres
and Boii, joined in the despatch of messengers
to the tribes living about the Alps and on the
Rhone, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;231.</span>
who from a word which means &#8220;serving for hire,&#8221; are
called Gaesatae. To their kings Concolitanus and Aneroetes
they offered a large sum of gold on the spot; and, for the future,
pointed out to them the greatness of the wealth of Rome, and
all the riches of which they would become possessed, if they
took it. In these attempts to inflame their cupidity and induce
them to join the expedition against Rome they easily succeeded.
For they added to the above arguments pledges of their own
alliance; and reminded them of the campaign of their own
ancestors in which they had seized Rome itself, and had been
masters of all it contained, as well as the city itself, for seven
months; and had at last evacuated it of their own free will,
and restored it by an act of free grace, returning unconquered
and scatheless with the booty to their own land. These arguments
made the leaders so eager for the expedition, that there
never at any other time came from that part of Gaul a larger
host, or one consisting of more notable warriors. Meanwhile,
the Romans, informed of what was coming, partly by report
and partly by conjecture, were in such a state of constant alarm
and excitement, that they hurriedly enrolled legions, collected
supplies, and sent out their forces to the frontier, as though
the enemy were already in their territory, before the Gauls
had stirred from their own lands.</p>

<p>It was this movement of the Gauls that, more than anything
else, helped the Carthaginians to consolidate their power in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Iberia. For the Romans, as I have said, looked upon the
Celtic question as the more pressing one of the two, as being so
near home; and were forced to wink at what was going on in
Iberia, in their anxiety to settle it satisfactorily first. Having,
therefore, put their relations with the Carthaginians on a safe
footing by the treaty with Hasdrubal, which I spoke of a short
time back,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> they gave an undivided attention to the Celtic war,
convinced that their interest demanded that a decisive battle
should be fought with them.</p>

<p><a name="b2_23" id="b2_23"><b>23.</b></a> The Gaesatae, then, having collected their forces, crossed
the Alps and descended into the valley of the Padus with a
formidable army, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 225.
Coss. L. Aemilius

armour, in the eighth year after the distribution
of the lands of Picenum. The Insubres and
Boii remained loyal to the agreement they had
made with them: but the Ven&#277;ti and Cenomani being induced
by embassies from Rome to take the Roman side, the Celtic
kings were obliged to leave a portion of their forces behind, to
guard against an invasion of their territory by those tribes.
They themselves, with their main army, consisting of one hundred
and fifty thousand foot, and twenty thousand horse and
chariots, struck camp and started on their march, which was
to be through Etruria, in high spirits. As soon as it was
known at Rome that the Celts had crossed the Alps, one of
the Consuls, Lucius Aemilius Papus, was sent with an army to
Ariminum to guard against the passage of the enemy, and one
of the Praetors into Etruria: for the other Consul, Gaius
Atilius Regulus, happened to be in Sardinia with his legions.
There was universal terror in Rome, for the danger threatening
them was believed to be great and formidable. And naturally
so: for the old fear of the Gauls had never been eradicated from
their minds. No one thought of anything else: they were
incessantly occupied in mustering the legions, or enrolling new
ones, and in ordering up such of the allies as were ready
for service. The proper magistrates were ordered to give in
lists of all citizens of military age; that it might at once be
known to what the total of the available forces amounted.
And such stores of corn, and darts, and other military equipments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
were collected as no one could remember on any
former occasion. From every side assistance was eagerly
rendered; for the inhabitants of Italy, in their terror at the
Gallic invasion, no longer thought of the matter as a question
of alliance with Rome, or of the war as undertaken to support
Roman supremacy, but each people regarded it as a danger
menacing themselves and their own city and territory. The
response to the Roman appeal therefore was prompt.</p>

<p><a name="b2_24" id="b2_24"><b>24.</b></a> But in order that we may learn from actual facts how
great the power was which Hannibal subsequently
ventured to attack, <span class="sidenote">The Roman
resources.</span>and what a mighty
empire he faced when he succeeded in inflicting
upon the Roman people the most severe disasters, I
must now state the amount of the forces they could at that
time bring into the field. The two Consuls had marched out
with four legions, each consisting of five thousand two hundred
infantry and three hundred cavalry. Besides this there were
with each Consul allies to the number of thirty thousand
infantry and two thousand cavalry. Of Sabines and Etruscans
too, there had come to Rome, for that special occasion, four
thousand horse and more than fifty thousand foot. These
were formed into an army and sent in advance into Etruria,
under the command of one of the Praetors. Moreover, the
Umbrians and Sarsinatae, hill tribes of the Apennine district,
were collected to the number of twenty thousand; and with
them were twenty thousand Ven&#277;ti and Cenomani. These
were stationed on the frontier of the Gallic territory, that they
might divert the attention of the invaders, by making an
incursion into the territory of the Boii. These were the forces
guarding the frontier. In Rome itself, ready as a reserve
in case of the accidents of war, there remained twenty thousand
foot and three thousand horse of citizens, and thirty thousand
foot and two thousand horse of the allies. Lists of men for
service had also been returned, of Latins eighty thousand foot
and five thousand horse; of Samnites seventy thousand foot and
seven thousand horse; of Iapygians and Messapians together
fifty thousand foot and sixteen thousand horse; and of Lucanians
thirty thousand foot and three thousand horse; of Marsi, and
Marrucini, and Ferentani, and Vestini, twenty thousand foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
and four thousand horse. And besides these, there were in
reserve in Sicily and Tarentum two legions, each of which consisted
of about four thousand two hundred foot, and two hundred
horse. Of the Romans and Campanians the total of those put
on the roll was two hundred and fifty thousand foot and twenty-three
thousand horse; so that the grand total of the forces actually
defending Rome was over 150,000 foot, 6000 cavalry:<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and of
the men able to bear arms, Romans and allies, over 700,000 foot
and 70,000 horse; while Hannibal, when he invaded Italy, had
less than twenty thousand to put against this immense force.</p>

<p><a name="b2_25" id="b2_25"><b>25.</b></a> There will be another opportunity of treating the
subject in greater detail; for the present I
must return to the Celts. <span class="sidenote">The Gauls
enter Etruria.</span>Having entered
Etruria, they began their march through the
country, devastating it as they chose, and without any
opposition; and finally directed their course against Rome
itself. But when they were encamped under the walls of
Clusium, which is three days&#8217; march from Rome, news was
brought them that the Roman forces, which were on duty in
Etruria, were following on their rear and were close upon them;
upon which they turned back to meet them, eager to offer
them battle. <span class="sidenote">The Praetor&#8217;s
army defeated
at Clusium.</span>The two armies came in sight
of each other about sunset, and encamped for
the night a short distance apart. But when
night fell, the Celts lit their watch fires; and leaving their
cavalry on the ground, with instructions that, as soon as
daylight made them visible to the enemy, they should follow
by the same route, they made a secret retreat along the road
to Faesulae, and took up their position there; that they
might be joined by their own cavalry, and might disconcert
the attack of the enemy. Accordingly, when at daybreak the
Romans saw that the cavalry were alone, they believed that
the Celts had fled, and hastened in pursuit of the retreating
horse; but when they approached the spot where the enemy
were stationed, the Celts suddenly left their position and fell
upon them. The struggle was at first maintained with fury on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>both sides: but the courage and superior numbers of the
Celts eventually gave them the victory. No less than six
thousand Romans fell: while the rest fled, most of whom
made their way to a certain strongly fortified height, and there
remained. The first impulse of the Celts was to besiege
them: but they were worn out by their previous night march,
and all the suffering and fatigue of the day; leaving therefore
a detachment of cavalry to keep guard round the hill, they
hastened to procure rest and refreshment, resolving to besiege
the fugitives next day unless they voluntarily surrendered.</p>

<p><a name="b2_26" id="b2_26"><b>26.</b></a> But meanwhile Lucius Aemilius, who had been stationed
on the coast of the Adriatic at Ariminum, <span class="sidenote">On the arrival
of Aemilius the
Gauls retire.</span>
having been informed that the Gauls had
entered Etruria and were approaching Rome,
set off to the rescue; and after a rapid march appeared on
the ground just at the critical moment. He pitched his
camp close to the enemy; and the fugitives on the hill, seeing
his watch fires, and understanding what had happened, quickly
recovered their courage and sent some of their men unarmed
to make their way through the forest and tell the Consul what
had happened. This news left the Consul as he thought no
alternative but to fight. He therefore ordered the Tribunes to
lead out the infantry at daybreak, while he, taking command
of the cavalry, led the way towards the hill. The Gallic
chieftains too had seen his watch fires, and understood that the
enemy was come; and at once held council of war. The
advice of King Aneroestes was, &#8220;that seeing the amount of
booty they had taken,&mdash;an incalculable quantity indeed of
captives, cattle, and other spoil,&mdash;they had better not run
the risk of another general engagement, but return home in
safety; and having disposed of this booty, and freed themselves
from its incumbrance, return, if they thought good, to make
another determined attack upon Rome.&#8221; Having resolved to
follow the advice of Aneroestes in the present juncture, the
chiefs broke up their night council, and before daybreak struck
camp, and marched through Etruria by the road which follows
the coast of the Ligurian bay. While Lucius, having taken off
the remnant of the army from the hill, and combined it with
his own forces, determined that it would not be by any means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
advantageous to offer the enemy regular battle; but that it was
better to dog their footsteps, watching for favourable times and
places at which to inflict damage upon them, or wrest some of
their booty from their hands.</p>

<p><a name="b2_27" id="b2_27"><b>27.</b></a> Just at that time the Consul Gaius Atilius had crossed
from Sardinia, and having landed at Pisae was
on his way to Rome; <span class="sidenote">Atilius landing at
Pisa intercepts
the march of
the Gauls.</span>and therefore he and
the enemy were advancing to meet each
other. When the Celts were at Telamon in
Etruria, their advanced guard fell in with that of Gaius, and
the men being made prisoners informed the Consul in answer
to questions of what had taken place; and told him that both the
armies were in the neighbourhood: that of the Celts, namely,
and that of Lucius close upon their rear. Though somewhat
disturbed at the events which he thus learnt, Gaius regarded
the situation as a hopeful one, when he considered that the
Celts were on the road between two hostile armies. He therefore
ordered the Tribunes to martial the legions and to advance
at the ordinary pace, and in line as far as the breadth of the
ground permitted; while he himself having surveyed a piece
of rising ground which commanded the road, and under which
the Celts must march, took his cavalry with him and hurried
on to seize the eminence, and so begin the battle in person;
convinced that by these means he would get the principal
credit of the action for himself. At first the Celts not knowing
anything about the presence of Gaius Atilius, but supposing
from what was taking place, that the cavalry of Aemilius had outmarched
them in the night, and were seizing the points of vantage
in the van of their route, immediately detached some cavalry and
light armed infantry to dispute the possession of this eminence.
But having shortly afterwards learnt the truth about the presence
of Gaius from a prisoner who was brought in, they hurriedly
got their infantry into position, and drew them up so as to
face two opposite ways, some, that is, to the front and others to
the rear. For they knew that one army was following on their
rear; and they expected from the intelligence which had reached
them, and from what they saw actually occurring, that they
would have to meet another on their front.</p>

<p><a name="b2_28" id="b2_28"><b>28.</b></a> Aemilius had heard of the landing of the legions at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Pisae, but had not expected them to be already so far on
their road; but the contest at the eminence proved to him
that the two armies were quite close. <span class="sidenote">The battle of
the horse.
Atilius falls.</span>
He
accordingly despatched his horse at once to
support the struggle for the possession of the
hill, while he marshalled his foot in their usual order, and
advanced to attack the enemy who barred his way. The
Celts had stationed the Alpine tribe of the Gaesatae to face
their enemies on the rear, and behind them the Insubres; on
their front they had placed the Taurisci, and the Cispadane
tribe of the Boii, facing the legions of Gaius. Their waggons
and chariots they placed on the extremity of either wing, while
the booty they massed upon one of the hills that skirted the
road, under the protection of a guard. The army of the Celts
was thus double-faced, and their mode of marshalling their
forces was effective as well as calculated to inspire terror. The
Insubres and Boii were clothed in their breeches and light
cloaks; but the Gaesatae from vanity and bravado threw these
garments away, and fell in in front of the army naked, with
nothing but their arms; believing that, as the ground was in
parts encumbered with brambles, which might possibly catch
in their clothes and impede the use of their weapons, they
would be more effective in this state. At first the only actual
fighting was that for the possession of the hill: and the numbers
of the cavalry, from all three armies, that had joined in
the struggle made it a conspicuous sight to all. In the
midst of it the Consul Gaius fell, fighting with reckless bravery
in the thick of the battle, and his head was brought to the
king of the Celts. The Roman cavalry, however, continued the
struggle with spirit, and finally won the position and overpowered
their opponents. Then the foot also came to close quarters.</p>

<p><a name="b2_29" id="b2_29"><b>29.</b></a> It was surely a peculiar and surprising battle to witness,
and scarcely less so to hear described. A battle, to begin
with, in which three distinct armies were engaged, must have
presented a strange and unusual appearance, and must have
been fought under strange and unusual conditions. Again, it
must have seemed to a spectator open to question, whether the
position of the Gauls were the most dangerous conceivable, from
being between two attacking forces; or the most favourable, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
enabling them to meet both armies at once, while their own two
divisions afforded each other a mutual support: and, above all,
as putting retreat out of the question, or any hope of safety except
in victory. For this is the peculiar advantage of having an
army facing in two opposite directions. The Romans, on the
other hand, while encouraged by having got their enemy between
two of their own armies, were at the same time dismayed
by the ornaments and clamour of the Celtic host. For there
were among them such innumerable horns and trumpets, which
were being blown simultaneously in all parts of their army, and
their cries were so loud and piercing, that the noise seemed not
to come merely from trumpets and human voices, but from
the whole country-side at once. Not less terrifying was the
appearance and rapid movement of the naked warriors in the
van, which indicated men in the prime of their strength and
beauty: while all the warriors in the front ranks were richly
adorned with gold necklaces and bracelets. These sights
certainly dismayed the Romans; still the hope they gave of a
profitable victory redoubled their eagerness for the battle.</p>

<p><a name="b2_30" id="b2_30"><b>30.</b></a> When the men who were armed with the <i>pilum</i> advanced
in front of the legions, in accordance
with the regular method of Roman warfare, <span class="sidenote">The infantry

and hurled their <i>pila</i> in rapid and effective
volleys, the inner ranks of the Celts found their jerkins
and leather breeches of great service; but to the naked
men in the front ranks this unexpected mode of attack caused
great distress and discomfiture. For the Gallic shields not
being big enough to cover the man, the larger the naked body
the more certainty was there of the <i>pilum</i> hitting. And at last,
not being able to retaliate, because the pilum-throwers were
out of reach, and their weapons kept pouring in, some of them,
in the extremity of their distress and helplessness, threw themselves
with desperate courage and reckless violence upon the
enemy, and thus met a voluntary death; while others gave
ground step by step towards their own friends, whom they
threw into confusion by this manifest acknowledgment of their
panic. Thus the courage of the Gaesatae had broken down
before the preliminary attack of the <i>pilum</i>. But when the
throwers of it had rejoined their ranks, and the whole Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
line charged, the Insubres, Boii, and Taurisci received the
attack, and maintained a desperate hand-to-hand fight. Though
almost cut to pieces, they held their ground with unabated
courage, in spite of the fact that man for man, as well as collectively,
they were inferior to the Romans in point of arms.
The shields and swords of the latter were proved to be manifestly
superior for defence and attack, for the Gallic sword can only
deliver a cut, but cannot thrust. And when, besides, the Roman
horse charged down from the high ground on their flank, and
attacked them vigorously, the infantry of the Celts were cut
to pieces on the field, while their horse turned and fled.</p>

<p><a name="b2_31" id="b2_31"><b>31.</b></a> Forty thousand of them were slain, and quite ten
thousand taken prisoners, among whom was one
of their kings, <span class="sidenote">Aemilius returns
home.</span>Concolitanus: the other king,
Aneroestes, fled with a few followers; joined
a few of his people in escaping to a place of security; and
there put an end to his own life and that of his friends.
Lucius Aemilius, the surviving Consul, collected the spoils of
the slain and sent them to Rome, and restored the property
taken by the Gauls to its owners. Then taking command
of the legions, he marched along the frontier of Liguria,
and made a raid upon the territory of the Boii; and having
satisfied the desires of the legions with plunder, returned with
his forces to Rome in a few days&#8217; march. There he adorned
the Capitol with the captured standards and necklaces, which
are gold chains worn by the Gauls round their necks; but
the rest of the spoils, and the captives, he converted to the
benefit of his own estate and to the adornment of his triumph.</p>

<p>Thus was the most formidable Celtic invasion repelled,
which had been regarded by all Italians, and especially by the
Romans, as a danger of the utmost gravity. The victory
inspired the Romans with a hope that they might be able to
entirely expel the Celts from the valley of the Padus: and
accordingly the Consuls of the next year, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;224.</span>
Quintus
Fulvius Flaccus and Titus Manlius Torquatus,
were both sent out with their legions, and military preparations
on a large scale, against them. By a rapid attack they
terrified the Boii into making submission to Rome; but the
campaign had no other practical effect, because, during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
rest of it, there was a season of excessive rains, and an
outbreak of pestilence in the army.</p>

<p><a name="b2_32" id="b2_32"><b>32.</b></a> The Consuls of the next year, however, Publius Furius
Philus and Caius Flaminius, once more invaded
the Celtic lands, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;223.</span>
marching through the territory
of the Anamares, who live not far from Placentia.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Having secured
the friendship of this tribe, they crossed into the country
of the Insubres, near the confluence of the Adua and Padus.
They suffered some annoyance from the enemy, as they were
crossing the river, and as they were pitching their camp; and
after remaining for a short time, they made terms with the
Insubres and left their country. After a circuitous march of
several days, they crossed the River Clusius, and came into the
territory of the Cenomani. As these people were allies of
Rome, they reinforced the army with some of their men,
which then descended once more from the Alpine regions
into the plains belonging to the Insubres, and began laying
waste their land and plundering their houses. The Insubrian
chiefs, seeing that nothing could change the determination of
the Romans to destroy them, determined that they had
better try their fortune by a great and decisive battle.
They therefore mustered all their forces, took down from the
temple of Minerva the golden standards, which are called &#8220;the
immovables,&#8221; and having made other necessary preparations,
in high spirits and formidable array, encamped opposite to
their enemies to the number of fifty thousand. Seeing themselves
thus out-numbered, the Romans at first determined to
avail themselves of the forces of the allied Celtic tribes; but
when they reflected on the fickle character of the Gauls, and
that they were about to fight with an enemy of the same race
as these auxiliary troops, they hesitated to associate such men
with themselves, at a crisis of such danger, and in an action of
such importance. However, they finally decided to do this.
They themselves stayed on the side of the river next the
enemy: and sending the Celtic contingent to the other side,
they pulled up the bridges; which at once precluded any
fear of danger from them, and left themselves no hope of safety
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>except in victory; the impassable river being thus in their rear.
These dispositions made, they were ready to engage.</p>

<p><a name="b2_33" id="b2_33"><b>33.</b></a> The Romans are thought to have shown uncommon
skill in this battle; the Tribunes instructing
the troops how they were to conduct themselves
both collectively and individually. <span class="sidenote">Battle with
the Insubres.</span>
They
had learned from former engagements that Gallic tribes
were always most formidable at the first onslaught, before their
courage was at all damped by a check; and that the swords
with which they were furnished, as I have mentioned before,
could only give one downward cut with any effect,
but that after this the edges got so turned and the blade
so bent, that unless they had time to straighten them with
their foot against the ground, they could not deliver a second
blow. The Tribunes accordingly gave out the spears of the
Triarii, who are the last of the three ranks, to the first ranks,
or Hastati: and ordering the men to use their swords only,
after their spears were done with, they charged the Celts
full in front. When the Celts had rendered their swords useless
by the first blows delivered on the spears, the Romans closed
with them, and rendered them quite helpless, by preventing them
from raising their hands to strike with their swords, which is
their peculiar and only stroke, because their blade has no point.
The Romans, on the contrary, having excellent points to their
swords, used them not to cut but to thrust: and by thus
repeatedly hitting the breasts and faces of the enemy, they
eventually killed the greater number of them. And this was due
to the foresight of the Tribunes: for the Consul Flaminius is
thought to have made a strategic mistake in his arrangements
for this battle. By drawing up his men along the very brink
of the river, he rendered impossible a man&oelig;uvre characteristic
of Roman tactics, because he left the lines no room for their
deliberate retrograde movements; for if, in the course of the
battle, the men had been forced ever so little from their ground,
they would have been obliged by this blunder of their leader to
throw themselves into the river. However, the valour of the
soldiers secured them a brilliant victory, as I have said, and
they returned to Rome with abundance of booty of every kind,
and of trophies stripped from the enemy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b2_34" id="b2_34"><b>34.</b></a> Next year, upon embassies coming from the Celts,
desiring peace and making unlimited offers of
submission, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;222.
Attack on the
Insubres.</span>the new Consuls, Marcus Claudius
Marcellus and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus,
were urgent that no peace should be granted them. Thus
frustrated, they determined to try a last chance, and once more
took active measures to hire thirty thousand Gaesatae,&mdash;the
Gallic tribe which lives on the Rhone. Having obtained these,
they held themselves in readiness, and waited for the attack of
their enemies. At the beginning of spring the Consuls assumed
command of their forces, and marched them into the territory
of the Insubres; and there encamped under the walls of the
city of Acerrae, which lies between the Padus and the Alps,
and laid siege to it. The Insubres, being unable to render
any assistance, because all the positions of vantage had been
seized by the enemy first, and being yet very anxious to break
up the siege of Acerrae, detached a portion of their forces to
affect a diversion by crossing the Padus and laying siege to
Clastidium. Intelligence of this movement being brought to
the Consuls, Marcus Claudius, taking with him his cavalry and
some light infantry, made a forced march to relieve the besieged
inhabitants. When the Celts heard of his approach,
they raised the siege; and, marching out to meet him, offered
him battle. At first they held their ground against a furious
charge of cavalry which the Roman Consul launched at them;
but when they presently found themselves surrounded by the
enemy on their rear and flank, unable to maintain the
fight any longer, they fled before the cavalry; and many of
them were driven into the river, and were swept away by the
stream, though the larger number were cut down by their
enemies. Acerrae also, richly stored with corn, fell into the
hands of the Romans: the Gauls having evacuated it, and
retired to Mediolanum, which is the most commanding position
in the territory of the Insubres. Gnaeus followed them
closely, and suddenly appeared at Mediolanum. The Gauls at
first did not stir; but upon his starting on his return march to
Acerrae, they sallied out, and having boldly attacked his rear,
killed a good many men, and even drove a part of it into
flight; until Gnaeus recalled some of his vanguard, and urged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
them to stand and engage the enemy. The Roman soldiers
obeyed orders, and offered a vigorous resistance to the attacking
party. The Celts, encouraged by their success, held their
ground for a certain time with some gallantry, but before long
turned and fled to the neighbouring mountains. Gnaeus followed
them, wasting the country as he went, and took Mediolanum
by assault. At this the chiefs of the Insubres, despairing of
safety, made a complete and absolute submission to Rome.</p>

<p><a name="b2_35" id="b2_35"><b>35.</b></a> Such was the end of the Celtic war: which, for the
desperate determination and boldness of the enemy, for the
obstinacy of the battles fought, and for the number of those
who fell and of those who were engaged, is second to none
recorded in history, but which, regarded as a specimen of
scientific strategy, is utterly contemptible. The Gauls showed
no power of planning or carrying out a campaign, and in
everything they did were swayed by impulse rather than by
sober calculation. As I have seen these tribes, after a short
struggle, entirely ejected from the valley of the Padus, with
the exception of some few localities lying close to the Alps, I
thought I ought not to let their original attack upon Italy pass
unrecorded, any more than their subsequent attempts, or their
final ejectment: for it is the function of the historian to record
and transmit to posterity such episodes in the drama of
Fortune; that our posterity may not from ignorance of the past
be unreasonably dismayed at the sudden and unexpected invasions
of these barbarians, but may reflect how short-lived and
easily damped the spirit of this race is; and so may stand to
their defence, and try every possible means before yielding an
inch to them. I think, for instance, that those who have
recorded for our information the invasion of
Greece by the Persians, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;480.<br /><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;279.</span>
and of Delphi by the
Gauls, have contributed materially to the
struggles made for the common freedom of Greece. For a
superiority in supplies, arms, or numbers, would scarcely
deter any one from putting the last possible hope to the test,
in a struggle for the integrity and the safety of his city and its
territory, if he had before his eyes the surprising result of those
expeditions; and remembered how many myriads of men, what
daring confidence, and what immense armaments were baffled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
by the skill and ability of opponents, who conducted their
measures under the dictates of reason and sober calculation.
And as an invasion of Gauls has been a source of alarm to
Greece in our day, as well as in ancient times, I thought it
worth while to give a summary sketch of their doings from the
earliest times.</p>

<p><a name="b2_36" id="b2_36"><b>36.</b></a> Our narrative now returns to Hasdrubal, whom we left
in command of the Carthaginian forces in Iberia. <span class="sidenote">Death of Hasdrubal
in Spain,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;221. See
chap. <a href="#b2_13">13</a>.</span>
After eight years command in that country, he
was assassinated in his own house at night by a
certain Celt in revenge for some private wrong.
Before his death he had done much to strengthen the Carthaginian
power in Iberia, not so much by military achievements,
as by the friendly relations which he maintained with the
native princes. <span class="sidenote">Succession of
Hannibal to the
command in
Spain. His hostility
to Rome.</span>
Now that he was dead, the Carthaginians
invested Hannibal with the command in Iberia,
in spite of his youth, because of the ability in
the conduct of affairs, and the daring spirit
which he had displayed. He had no sooner
assumed the command, than he nourished a fixed
resolve to make war on Rome; nor was it long before he
carried out this resolution. From that time forth there were
constant suspicions and causes of offence arising between the
Carthaginians and Romans. And no wonder: for the Carthaginians
were meditating revenge for their defeats in Sicily; and
the Romans were made distrustful from a knowledge of their
designs. These things made it clear to every one of correct
judgment that before long a war between these two nations
was inevitable.</p>

<p><a name="b2_37" id="b2_37"><b>37.</b></a> At the same period the Achaean league and King
Philip, with their allies, were entering upon the
war with the Aetolian league, <span class="sidenote">Social war, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
220-217.</span>which is called the
Social war. Now this was the point at which I
proposed to begin my general history; and as I have brought
the account of the affairs of Sicily and Libya, and those which
immediately followed, in a continuous narrative, up to the date
of the beginning of the Social and Second Punic, generally
called the Hannibalic, wars, it will be proper to leave this branch
of my subject for a while, and to take up the history of events<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
in Greece, that I may start upon my full and detailed narrative,
after bringing the prefatory sketch of the history of the several
countries to the same point of time. For since I have not
undertaken, as previous writers have done, to write the history
of particular peoples, such as the Greeks or Persians, but the
history of all known parts of the world at once, because there
was something in the state of our own times which made such
a plan peculiarly feasible,&mdash;of which I shall speak more at
length hereafter,&mdash;it will be proper, before entering on my main
subject, to touch briefly on the state of the most important of
the recognised nations of the world.</p>

<p>Of Asia and Egypt I need not speak before the time at
which my history commences. The previous history of these
countries has been written by a number of historians
already, and is known to all the world; nor in our days has
any change specially remarkable or unprecedented occurred to
them demanding a reference to their past. <span class="sidenote">The progress of
the Achaean
league.</span>But in regard to
the Achaean league, and the royal family of
Macedonia, it will be in harmony with my
design to go somewhat farther back: for
the latter has become entirely extinct; while the Achaeans,
as I have stated before, have in our time made extraordinary
progress in material prosperity and internal unity.
For though many statesmen had tried in past times to induce
the Peloponnesians to join in a league for the common interests
of all, and had always failed, because every one was working
to secure his own power rather than the freedom of the whole;
yet in our day this policy has made such progress, and been
carried out with such completeness, that not only is there in
the Peloponnese a community of interests such as exists between
allies or friends, but an absolute identity of laws, weights,
measures, and currency.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> All the States have the same magistrates,
senate, and judges. Nor is there any difference
between the entire Peloponnese and a single city, except in
the fact that its inhabitants are not included within the
same wall; in other respects, both as a whole and in their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>individual cities, there is a nearly absolute assimilation of
institutions.</p>

<p><a name="b2_38" id="b2_38"><b>38.</b></a> It will be useful to ascertain, to begin with, how it
came to pass that the name of the Achaeans
became the universal one for all the inhabitants
of the Peloponnese. <span class="sidenote">The origin of the
name as embracing
all the
Peloponnese.</span>For the original
bearers of this ancestral name have no
superiority over others, either in the size of their territory
and cities, or in wealth, or in the prowess of their men. For
they are a long way off being superior to the Arcadians
and Lacedaemonians in number of inhabitants and extent
of territory; nor can these latter nations be said to yield
the first place in warlike courage to any Greek people
whatever. Whence then comes it that these nations, with
the rest of the inhabitants of the Peloponnese, have been
content to adopt the constitution and the name of the
Achaeans? To speak of chance in such a matter would not
be to offer any adequate solution of the question, and would
be a mere idle evasion. A cause must be sought; for without
a cause nothing, expected or unexpected, can be accomplished.
The cause then, in my opinion, was this. Nowhere
could be found a more unalloyed and deliberately established
system of equality and absolute freedom, and, in a word, of
democracy, than among the Achaeans. This constitution
found many of the Peloponnesians ready enough to adopt
it of their own accord: many were brought to share in it by
persuasion and argument: some, though acting under compulsion
at first, were quickly brought to acquiesce in its benefits;
for none of the original members had any special privilege
reserved for them, but equal rights were given to all comers:
the object aimed at was therefore quickly attained by the two
most unfailing expedients of equality and fraternity. This
then must be looked upon as the source and original cause
of Peloponnesian unity and consequent prosperity.</p>

<p>That this was the original principle on which the Achaeans
acted in forming their constitution might be demonstrated by
many proofs; but for the present purpose it will be sufficient
to allege one or two in confirmation of my assertion.</p>

<p><a name="b2_39" id="b2_39"><b>39.</b></a> And first: When the burning of the Pythagorean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
clubs in Magna Grecia was followed by great constitutional
disturbances, as was natural on the sudden disappearance of
the leading men in each state; and the Greek cities in that
part of Italy became the scene of murder, revolutionary warfare,
and every kind of confusion; deputations were sent from most
parts of Greece to endeavour to bring about some settlement
of these disorders.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> But the disturbed states preferred the
intervention of the Achaeans above all others, and showed
the greatest confidence in them, in regard to the measures to
be adopted for removing the evils that oppressed them. Nor
was this the only occasion on which they displayed this preference.
For shortly afterwards there was a general movement
among them to adopt the model of the Achaean constitution.
The first states to move in the matter were Croton, Sybaris,
and Caulonia, who began by erecting a common temple to Zeus
Homorios,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and a place in which to hold their meetings and
common councils. <span class="sidenote">&#918;&#949;&#8059;&#962; &#8001;&#956;&#8049;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; or &#7936;&#956;&#8049;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> They then adopted the laws
and customs of the Achaeans, and determined
to conduct their constitution according to their
principles; but finding themselves hampered by the tyranny of
Dionysius of Syracuse, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;405-367.</span>and also by the encroachment
of the neighbouring barbarians, they were
forced much against their will to abandon them. Again, later on,
when the Lacedaemonians met with their unexpected reverse
at Leuctra, and the Thebans as unexpectedly claimed the hegemony
in Greece, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;371.</span>
a feeling of uncertainty prevailed
throughout the country, and especially among the
Lacedaemonians and Thebans themselves, because the former
refused to allow that they were beaten, the latter felt hardly certain
that they had conquered. On this occasion, once more, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>Achaeans were the people selected by the two parties, out of all
Greece, to act as arbitrators on the points in dispute. And
this could not have been from any special view of their power,
for at that time they were perhaps the weakest state in Greece;
it was rather from a conviction of their good faith and high
principles, in regard to which there was but one opinion
universally entertained. At that period of their history, however,
they possessed only the elements of success; success
itself, and material increase, were barred by the fact that they
had not yet been able to produce a leader worthy of the
occasion. Whenever any man had given indications of such
ability, he was systematically thrust into the background and
hampered, at one time by the Lacedaemonian government, and
at another, still more effectually, by that of Macedonia.</p>

<p><a name="b2_40" id="b2_40"><b>40.</b></a> When at length, however, the country did obtain
leaders of sufficient ability, it quickly manifested its intrinsic
excellence by the accomplishment of that most glorious achievement,-&#8212;the
union of the Peloponnese. The originator of
this policy in the first instance was Aratus of Sicyon; its active
promotion and consummation was due to Philopoemen of
Megalopolis; while Lycortas and his party must be looked
upon as the authors of the permanence which it enjoyed. The
actual achievements of these several statesmen I shall narrate
in their proper places: but while deferring a more detailed
account of the other two, I think it will be right to briefly record
here, as well as in a future portion of my work, the political
measures of Aratus, because he has left a record of them himself
in an admirably honest and lucid book of commentaries.</p>

<p>I think the easiest method for myself, and most intelligible
to my readers, will be to start from the period of the restoration
of the Achaean league and federation, after its disintegration
into separate states by the Macedonian kings: from which
time it has enjoyed an unbroken progress towards the state of
completion which now exists, and of which I have already
spoken at some length.</p>

<p><a name="b2_41" id="b2_41"><b>41.</b></a> The period I mean is the 124th Olympiad. In this
occurred the first league of Patrae and Dyme,
and the deaths of Ptolemy son of Lagus,
Lysimachus, Seleucus, Ptolemy Ceraunus. <span class="sidenote">124th Olympiad,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;284-280.</span>In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the period before this the state of Achaia was as follows. It
was ruled by kings from the time of Tisamenus, son of Orestes,
who, being expelled from Sparta on the return of the Heraclidae,
formed a kingdom in Achaia. The last of this royal line to
maintain his power was Ogyges, whose sons so alienated the
people by their unconstitutional and tyrannical government,
that a revolution took place and a democracy was established.
In the period subsequent to this, <span class="sidenote">First Achaean league.</span>up to the
time of the establishment of the supreme
authority of Alexander and Philip, their fortunes
were subject to various fluctuations, but they always
endeavoured to maintain intact in their league a democratical
form of government, as I have already stated. This league
consisted of twelve cities, all of them still surviving, with the
exception of Olenus, and Helice which was engulfed by the
sea before the battle of Leuctra. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;371.</span>The other
ten were Patrae, Dyme, Pharae, Tritaea, Leontium,
Aegium, Aegeira, Pellene, Bura, Caryneia. In the
period immediately succeeding Alexander, and
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;323-284.</span>before the above-named 124th Olympiad, these
cities, chiefly through the instrumentality of the Macedonian
kings, became so estranged and ill-disposed to each other,
and so divided and opposed in their interests, that some of
them had to submit to the presence of foreign garrisons, sent
first by Demetrius and Cassander, and afterwards by Antigonus
Gonatas, while others even fell under the power of Tyrants;
for no one set up more of such absolute rulers in the Greek
states than this last-named king.</p>

<p>But about the 124th Olympiad, as I have said, a change
of sentiment prevailed among the Achaean
cities, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;284-280,
Second Achaean
league.</span>
and they began again to form a league.
This was just at the time of Pyrrhus&#8217;s invasion
of Italy. The first to take this step were the peoples
of Dyme, Patrae, Tritaea, and Pharae. And as they thus
formed the nucleus of the league, we find no column extant
recording the compact between these cities. But about
five years afterwards the people of Aegium expelled their
foreign garrison and joined the league; next, the people
of Bura put their tyrant to death and did the same; simultaneously,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the state of Caryneia was restored to the league.
For Iseas, the then tyrant of Caryneia, when he saw the expulsion
of the garrison from Aegium, and the death of the
despot in Bura at the hands of Margos and the Achaeans,
and when he saw that he was himself on the point of being attacked
on all sides, voluntarily laid down his office; and having
obtained a guarantee for his personal safety from the Achaeans,
formally gave in the adhesion of his city to the league.</p>

<p><a name="b2_42" id="b2_42"><b>42.</b></a> My object in thus going back in point of time was,
first, to show clearly at what epoch the Achaeans entered into
the second league, which exists at this day, and which were the
first members of the original league to do so; and, secondly,
that the continuity of the policy pursued by the Achaeans
might rest, not on my word only, but on the evidence of the
actual facts. It was in virtue of this policy,&mdash;by holding
out the bait of equality and freedom, and by invariably
making war upon and crushing those who on their own account,
or with the support of the kings, enslaved any of the
states within their borders, that they finally accomplished the
design which they had deliberately adopted, in some cases by
their own unaided efforts, and in others by the help of their
allies. For in fact whatever was effected in this direction, by
the help of these allies in after times, must be put down to
the credit of the deliberately adopted policy of the Achaeans
themselves. They acted indeed jointly with others in many
honourable undertakings, and in none more so than with the
Romans: yet in no instance can they be said to have
aimed at obtaining from their success any advantage for a
particular state. In return for the zealous assistance rendered
by them to their allies, they bargained for nothing but the
freedom of each state and the union of the Peloponnese. But
this will be more clearly seen from the record of their actual
proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="b2_43" id="b2_43"><b>43.</b></a> For the first twenty-five years of the league between the

union were elected by each city in turn. But after this period
they determined to appoint one strategus only,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> and put the entire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
management of the affairs of the union in his hands. The

In the fourth year after this man&#8217;s tenure
of the office, Aratus of Sicyon caused his city to
join the league, which, by his energy and courage,
he had, when only twenty years of age, delivered from the yoke
of its tyrant. In the eighth year again after
this, Aratus, being elected strategus for the
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;243-242.</span>
second time, laid a plot to seize the Acrocorinthus, then held
by Antigonus; and by his success freed the inhabitants of the
Peloponnese from a source of serious alarm: and having thus
liberated Corinth he caused it to join the league. <span class="sidenote">Victory of
Lutatius off the

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;241.</span>In his
same term of office he got Megara into his
hands, and caused it to join also. These events
occurred in the year before the decisive defeat
of the Carthaginians, in consequence of which
they evacuated Sicily and consented for the first time to pay
tribute to Rome.</p>

<p>Having made this remarkable progress in his design in so
short a time, Aratus continued thenceforth in the position of
leader of the Achaean league, and in the consistent direction
of his whole policy to one single end; which was to expel
Macedonians from the Peloponnese, to depose the despots,
and to establish in each state the common freedom which
their ancestors had enjoyed before them. So long, therefore,
as Antigonus Gonatas was alive, <span class="sidenote">Antigonus
Gonatas,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;283-239.</span>
he maintained
a continual opposition to his interference, as well
as to the encroaching spirit of the Aetolians, and
in both cases with signal skill and success; although their
presumption and contempt for justice had risen to such a
pitch, that they had actually made a formal compact with each
other for the disruption of the Achaeans.</p>

<p><a name="b2_44" id="b2_44"><b>44.</b></a> After the death of Antigonus, however, the Achaeans
made terms with the Aetolians, and joined them energetically
in the war against Demetrius; and, in place of the feelings of
estrangement and hostility, there gradually grew up a sentiment
of brotherhood and affection between the two peoples. Upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>the death of Demetrius, after a reign of only ten years,
just about the time of the first invasion of
Illyricum by the Romans, <span class="sidenote">Demetrius,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;239-229.</span>the Achaeans had
a most excellent opportunity of establishing
the policy which they had all along maintained. For the
despots in the Peloponnese were in despair at the death
of Demetrius. It was the loss to them of their chief supporter
and paymaster. And now Aratus was for ever impressing
upon them that they ought to abdicate, holding out
rewards and honours for those of them who consented, and
threatening those who refused with still greater vengeance
from the Achaeans. There was therefore a general movement
among them to voluntarily restore their several states to freedom
and to join the league. I ought however to say that
Ludiades of Megalopolis, in the lifetime of Demetrius, of
his own deliberate choice, and foreseeing with great shrewdness
and good sense what was going to happen, had abdicated
his sovereignty and become a citizen of the national league.
His example was followed by Aristomachus, tyrant of Argos,
Xeno of Hermione, and Cleonymus of Phlius, who all likewise
abdicated and joined the democratic league.</p>

<p><a name="b2_45" id="b2_45"><b>45.</b></a> But the increased power and national advancement which these events
brought to the Achaeans excited the envy of the Aetolians; who,
<span class="sidenote">The Aetolians and Antigonus Doson, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;229-220.</span>besides
their natural inclination to unjust and selfish aggrandisement, were
inspired with the hope of breaking up the union of Achaean states, as
they had before succeeded in partitioning those of Acarnania with
Alexander,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> and had planned to do those of Achaia with Antigonus
Gonatas. Instigated once more by similar expectations, they had now the
assurance to enter into communication and close alliance at once with
Antigonus (at that time ruling Macedonia as guardian of the young King
Philip), and with Cleomenes, King of Sparta. They saw that Antigonus had
undisputed possession of the throne of Macedonia, while he was an open
and avowed enemy of the Achaeans owing to the surprise of the
Acrocorinthus; and they supposed that if they could get the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>Lacedaemonians to join them in their hostility to the league,
they would easily subdue it, by selecting a favourable opportunity
for their attack, and securing that it should be assaulted
on all sides at once. And they would in all probability have
succeeded, but that they had left out the most important element
in the calculation, namely, that in Aratus they had to
reckon with an opponent to their plans of ability equal to
almost any emergency. Accordingly, when they attempted
this violent and unjust interference in Achaia, so far from
succeeding in any of their devices, they, on the contrary,
strengthened Aratus, the then president of the league, as well as
the league itself. So consummate was the ability with which
he foiled their plan and reduced them to impotence. The
manner in which this was done will be made clear in what I
am about to relate.</p>

<p><a name="b2_46" id="b2_46"><b>46.</b></a> There could be no doubt of the policy of the Aetolians.
They were ashamed indeed to attack the Achaeans
openly, <span class="sidenote">The Aetolians
intrigue with
Cleomenes, King
of Sparta,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;229-227.</span>
because they could not ignore their
recent obligations to them in the war with
Demetrius: but they were plotting with the
Lacedaemonians; and showed their jealousy of
the Achaeans by not only conniving at the treacherous attack
of Cleomenes upon Tegea, Mantinea, and Orchomenus (cities
not only in alliance with them, but actually members of their
league), but by confirming his occupation of those places. In old
times they had thought almost any excuse good enough to justify
an appeal to arms against those who, after all, had done them no
wrong: yet they now allowed themselves to be treated with such
treachery, and submitted without remonstrance to the loss of
the most important towns, solely with the view of creating in
Cleomenes a formidable antagonist to the Achaeans. These
facts were not lost upon Aratus and the other officers of the
league: and they resolved that, without taking the initiative in
going to war with any one, they would resist the attempts of
the Lacedaemonians. Such was their determination, and for a
time they persisted in it: but immediately afterwards Cleomenes
began to build the hostile fort in the territory of
Megalopolis, called the Athenaeum,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> and showed an undisguised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
and bitter hostility. Aratus and his colleagues accordingly
summoned a meeting of the league, and it was decided
to proclaim war openly against Sparta.</p>

<p><a name="b2_47" id="b2_47"><b>47.</b></a> This was the origin of what is called the Cleomenic
war. At first the Achaeans were for depending
on their own resources for facing the Lacedaemonians. <span class="sidenote">Cleomenes,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;227-221.</span>
They looked upon it as more honourable
not to look to others for preservation, but to guard their
own territory and cities themselves; and at the same time the
remembrances of his former services made them desirous of
keeping up their friendship with Ptolemy,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> and averse from the
appearance of seeking aid elsewhere. But when the war had
lasted some time; and Cleomenes had revolutionised the constitution
of his country, and had turned its constitutional
monarchy into a despotism; and, moreover, was conducting
the war with extraordinary skill and boldness: <span class="sidenote">Aratus applies
to Antigonus
Doson.</span>seeing
clearly what would happen, and fearing the
reckless audacity of the Aetolians, Aratus
determined that his first duty was to be well
beforehand in frustrating their plans. He satisfied himself
that Antigonus was a man of activity and practical ability,
with some pretensions to the character of a man of honour;
he however knew perfectly well that kings look on no man
as a friend or foe from personal considerations, but ever
measure friendships and enmities solely by the standard of
expediency. He, therefore, conceived the idea of addressing
himself to this monarch, and entering into friendly relations
with him, taking occasion to point out to him the certain result of
his present policy. But to act openly in this matter he thought
inexpedient for several reasons. By doing so he would not
only incur the opposition of Cleomenes and the Aetolians, but
would cause consternation among the Achaeans themselves,
because his appeal to their enemies would give the impression
that he had abandoned all the hopes he once had in them.
This was the very last idea he desired should go abroad; and
he therefore determined to conduct this intrigue in secrecy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>The result of this was that he was often compelled to speak
and act towards the public in a sense contrary to his true
sentiments, that he might conceal his real design by suggesting
one of an exactly opposite nature. For which reason
there are some particulars which he did not even commit to
his own commentaries.</p>

<p><a name="b2_48" id="b2_48"><b>48.</b></a> It did not escape the observation of Aratus that the
people of Megalopolis would be more ready than others to seek
the protection of Antigonus, and the hopes of safety offered by
Macedonia; for their neighbourhood to Sparta exposed them
to attack before the other states; while they were unable to get
the help which they ought to have, because the Achaeans were
themselves hard pressed and in great difficulties. Besides
they had special reasons for entertaining feelings of affection
towards the royal family of Macedonia, <span class="sidenote">Philip II. in the
Peloponnese,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;338.</span>founded
on the favours received in the time of Philip,
son of Amyntas. He therefore imparted his
general design under pledge of secrecy to Nicophanes and
Cercidas of Megalopolis, who were family friends of his own
and of a character suited to the undertaking; and by their means
experienced no difficulty in inducing the people of Megalopolis
to send envoys to the league, to advise that an application for
help should be made to Antigonus. Nicophanes and Cercidas
were themselves selected to go on this mission to the league,
and thence, if their view was accepted, to Antigonus. The
league consented to allow the people of Megalopolis to send
the mission; and accordingly Nicophanes lost no time in obtaining
an interview with the king. About the interests of his
own country he spoke briefly and summarily, confining himself
to the most necessary statements; the greater part of his
speech was, in accordance with the directions of Aratus,
concerned with the national question.</p>

<p><a name="b2_49" id="b2_49"><b>49.</b></a> The points suggested by Aratus for the envoy to dwell
on were &#8220;the scope and object of the understanding
between the Aetolians and Cleomenes, <span class="sidenote">The message to
Antigonus Doson.</span>
and the necessity of caution on the part primarily
of the Achaeans, but still more even on that of Antigonus himself:
first, because the Achaeans plainly could not resist the
attack of both; and, secondly, because if the Aetolians and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Cleomenes conquered them, any man of sense could easily see
that they would not be satisfied or stop there. For the
encroaching spirit of the Aetolians, far from being content to
be confined by the boundaries of the Peloponnese, would find
even those of Greece too narrow for them. Again, the ambition
of Cleomenes was at present directed to the supremacy in the
Peloponnese: but this obtained, he would promptly aim at that
of all Greece, in which it would be impossible for him to
succeed without first crushing the government of Macedonia.
They were, therefore, to urge him to consider, with a view to
the future, which of the two courses would be the more to his
own interests,&mdash;to fight for supremacy in Greece in conjunction
with the Achaeans and Boeotians against Cleomenes in
the Peloponnese; or to abandon the most powerful race, and to
stake the Macedonian empire on a battle in Thessaly, against a
combined force of Aetolians and Boeotians, with the Achaeans
and Lacedaemonians to boot. If the Aetolians, from regard
to the goodwill shown them by the Achaeans in the time of
Demetrius, were to pretend to be anxious to keep the peace
as they were at present doing, they were to assert that the
Achaeans were ready to engage Cleomenes by themselves;
and if fortune declared in their favour they would want no
assistance from any one: but if fortune went against them,
and the Aetolians joined in the attack, they begged him to
watch the course of events, that he might not let things go
too far, but might aid the Peloponnesians while they were
still capable of being saved. He had no need to be anxious
about the good faith or gratitude of the Achaeans: when the
time for action came, Aratus pledged himself to find guarantees
which would be satisfactory to both parties; and similarly
would himself indicate the moment at which the aid should
be given.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b2_50" id="b2_50"><b>50.</b></a> These arguments seemed to Antigonus to have been
put by Aratus with equal sincerity and ability: and after
listening to them, he eagerly took the first necessary step by
writing a letter to the people of Megalopolis with an offer of
assistance, on condition that such a measure should receive the
consent of the Achaeans. When Nicophanes and Cercidas
returned home and delivered this despatch from the king,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
reporting at the same time his other expressions of goodwill and
zeal in the cause, the spirits of the people of Megalopolis were
greatly elated; and they were all eagerness to attend the
meeting of the league, and urge that measures should be taken
to secure the alliance of Antigonus, and to put the management
of the war in his hands with all despatch. <span class="sidenote">Aratus wishes to
do without the
king if possible.</span>
Aratus learnt privately from Nicophanes the
king&#8217;s feelings towards the league and towards
himself; and was delighted that his plan had not failed, and
that he had not found the king completely alienated from
himself, as the Aetolians hoped he would be. He regarded
it also as eminently favourable to his policy, that the people
of Megalopolis were so eager to use the Achaean league
as the channel of communication with Antigonus. For his
first object was if possible to do without this assistance; but
if he were compelled to have recourse to it, he wished that
the invitation should not be sent through himself personally,
but that it should rather come from the Achaeans as a nation.
For he feared that, if the king came, and conquered Cleomenes
and the Lacedaemonians in the war, and should then adopt any
policy hostile to the interests of the national constitution, he
would have himself by general consent to bear the blame of
the result: while Antigonus would be justified, by the injury
which had been inflicted on the royal house of Macedonia
in the matter of the Acrocorinthus. Accordingly when
Megalopolitan envoys appeared in the national council,
and showed the royal despatch, and further declared the
general friendly disposition of the king, and added an appeal
to the congress to secure the king&#8217;s alliance without delay;
and when also the sense of the meeting was clearly shown
to be in favour of taking this course, Aratus rose, and, after
setting forth the king&#8217;s zeal, and complimenting the meeting
upon their readiness to act in the matter, he proceeded to
urge upon them in a long speech that &#8220;They should try if
possible to preserve their cities and territory by their own
efforts, for that nothing could be more honourable or more
expedient than that: but that, if it turned out that fortune
declared against them in this effort, they might then have
recourse to the assistance of their friends; but not until they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
had tried all their own resources to the uttermost.&#8221; This
speech was received with general applause: and it was decided
to take no fresh departure at present, and to endeavour to
bring the existing war to a conclusion unaided.</p>

<p><a name="b2_51" id="b2_51"><b>51.</b></a> But when Ptolemy, despairing of retaining the league&#8217;s
friendship, began to furnish Cleomenes with <span class="sidenote">Euergetes jealous
of the Macedonian
policy of Aratus,
helps Cleomenes.</span>
supplies,&mdash;which he did with a view of setting
him up as a foil to Antigonus, thinking the
Lacedaemonians offered him better hopes than
the Achaeans of being able to thwart the policy of the Macedonian
kings; and when the Achaeans themselves had suffered
three defeats,&mdash;one at Lycaeum in an engagement with Cleomenes
whom they had met on a march; and again in a pitched
battle at Ladocaea in the territory of Megalopolis, in which
Lydiades fell; and a third time decisively at a place called Hecatomboeum
in the territory of Dyme where their whole forces had
been engaged,&mdash;after these misfortunes, no further delay was
possible, and they were compelled by the force of circumstances
to appeal unanimously to Antigonus. Thereupon Aratus sent
his son to Antigonus, and ratified the terms of the subvention.
The great difficulty was this: it was believed to be certain that
the king would send no assistance, except on the condition of
the restoration of the Acrocorinthus, and of having the city
of Corinth put into his hands as a base of operations in this
war; and on the other hand it seemed impossible that the
Achaeans should venture to put the Corinthians in the king&#8217;s
power against their own consent. The final determination of
the matter was accordingly postponed, that they might
investigate the question of the securities to be given to the
king.</p>

<p><a name="b2_52" id="b2_52"><b>52.</b></a> Meanwhile, on the strength of the dismay caused by
his successes, Cleomenes was making an unopposed
progress through the cities, <span class="sidenote">The Achaeans
offer to surrender
the Acrocorinthus
to Antigonus.</span>
winning
some by persuasion and others by threats. In
this way, he got possession of Caphyae, Pellene,
Pheneus, Argos, Phlius, Cleonae, Epidaurus, Hermione,
Troezen, and last of all Corinth, while he personally commanded
a siege of Sicyon. But this in reality relieved the Achaeans
from a very grave difficulty. For the Corinthians by ordering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Aratus, as Strategus of the league, and the Achaeans to
evacuate the town, and by sending messages to Cleomenes
inviting his presence, gave the Achaeans a ground of action
and a reasonable pretext for moving. Aratus was quick to
take advantage of this; and, as the Achaeans were in actual
possession of the Acrocorinthus, he made his peace with the
royal family of Macedonia by offering it to Antigonus; and
at the same time gave thus a sufficient guarantee for friendship
in the future, and further secured Antigonus a base of
operations for the war with Sparta.</p>

<p>Upon learning of this compact between the league and
Antigonus, Cleomenes raised the siege of <span class="sidenote">Cleomenes prepares
to resist.</span>
Sicyon and pitched his camp near the Isthmus;
and, having thrown up a line of fortification
uniting the Acrocorinthus with the mountain called the
&#8220;Ass&#8217;s Back,&#8221; began from this time to expect with confidence
the empire of the Peloponnese. But Antigonus had made his
preparations long in advance, in accordance with the suggestion
of Aratus, and was only waiting for the right moment to act.
<span class="sidenote">Antigonus comes
to the Isthmus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;224.</span>
And now the news which he received convinced
him that the entrance of Cleomenes
into Thessaly, at the head of an army, was only
a question of a very few days: he accordingly despatched
envoys to Aratus and the league to conclude the terms
of the treaty<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> and marched to the Isthmus with his army
by way of Euboea. He took this route because the Aetolians,
after trying other expedients for preventing Antigonus bringing
this aid, now forbade his marching south of Thermopylae with
an army, threatening that, if he did, they would offer armed
opposition to his passage.</p>

<p><a name="b2_53" id="b2_53"><b>53.</b></a> Thus Antigonus and Cleomenes were encamped face
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>to face: the former desirous of effecting an entrance into the
Peloponnese, Cleomenes determined to prevent him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Achaeans, in spite of their severe disasters,
did not abandon their purpose or give up all
hopes of retrieving their fortunes. <span class="sidenote">The Achaeans
seize Argos.</span>
They gave
Aristotle of Argos assistance when he headed a
rising against the Cleomenic faction; and, under the command
of Timoxenus the Strategus, surprised and seized Argos. And
this must be regarded as the chief cause of the improvement
which took place in their fortunes; for this reverse checked the
ardour of Cleomenes and damped the courage of his soldiers
in advance, as was clearly shown by what took place afterwards.
For though Cleomenes had already possession of more advantageous
posts, and was in the enjoyment of more abundant
supplies than Antigonus, and was at the same time inspired
with superior courage and ambition: yet, as soon as he was informed
that Argos was in the hands of the Achaeans, he at once
drew back, abandoned all these advantages, and retreated from
the Isthmus with every appearance of precipitation, in terror of
being completely surrounded by his enemies. At first he retired
upon Argos, and for a time made some attempt to regain the
town. But the Achaeans offered a gallant resistance; and the
Argives themselves were stirred up to do the same by remorse
for having admitted him before: and so, having failed in this
attempt also, he marched back to Sparta by way of Mantinea.</p>

<p><a name="b2_54" id="b2_54"><b>54.</b></a> On his part, Antigonus advanced without any casualty
into the Peloponnese, and took over the
Acrocorinthus; <span class="sidenote">Antigonus receives
the Acrocorinthus.</span>
and, without wasting time there,
pushed on in his enterprise and entered Argos.
He only stayed there long enough to compliment the Argives
on their conduct, and to provide for the security of the
city; and then immediately starting again directed his
march towards Arcadia; and after ejecting the garrisons
from the posts which had been fortified by Cleomenes in the
territories of Aegys and Belmina, and, putting those strongholds
in the hands of the people of Megalopolis, he went
to Aegium to attend the meeting of the Achaean league.
There he made a statement of his own proceedings, and consulted
with the meeting as to the measures to be taken in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
future. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the allied
army, and went into winter quarters at Sicyon and Corinth.</p>

<p>At the approach of spring he broke up his camp and got
on the march. On the third day he arrived at <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;223.
Recovery of
Tegea.</span>
Tegea, and being joined there by the Achaean
forces, he proceeded to regularly invest the city.
But the vigour displayed by the Macedonians in conducting
the siege, and especially in the digging of mines, soon reduced
the Tegeans to despair, and they accordingly surrendered.
After taking the proper measures for securing the town,
Antigonus proceeded to extend his expedition. <span class="sidenote">Skirmish with
Cleomenes.</span>He now
marched with all speed into Laconia; and having
found Cleomenes in position on the frontier, he
was trying to bring him to an engagement, and
was harassing him with skirmishing attacks, when news was
brought to him by his scouts that the garrison <span class="sidenote">Capture of
Orchomenus and Mantinea.</span>
of Orchomenus had started to join Cleomenes.
He at once broke up his camp, hurried thither,
and carried the town by assault. Having done that, he next
invested Mantinea and began to besiege it.
This town also being soon terrified into surrender
by the Macedonians, he started again along the road to
Heraea and Telphusa. <span class="sidenote">and Heraea and
Telphusa.</span>
These towns, too, being
secured by the voluntary surrender of their inhabitants,
as the winter was by this time approaching,
he went again to Aegium to attend the meeting of
the league. His Macedonian soldiers he sent away to winter
at home, while he himself remained to confer with the
Achaeans on the existing state of affairs.</p>

<p><a name="b2_55" id="b2_55"><b>55.</b></a> But Cleomenes was on the alert. He saw that the
Macedonians in the army of Antigonus had been sent home;
and that the king and his mercenaries in Aegium were three
days&#8217; march from Megalopolis; and this latter town he well
knew to be difficult to guard, owing to its great extent, and the
sparseness of its inhabitants; and, moreover, that it was just
then being kept with even greater carelessness than usual, owing
to Antigonus being in the country; and what was more important
than anything else, he knew that the larger number of
its men of military age had fallen at the battles of Lycaeum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
and Ladoceia. There happened to be residing in Megalopolis
some Messenian exiles; by whose help he managed, under
cover of night, to get within the walls without being detected.
When day broke he had a narrow escape from being ejected, if
not from absolute destruction, through the valour of the citizens.
This had been his fortune three months before, when he had
made his way into the city by the region which is called the
C&#333;laeum: but on this occasion, by the superiority of his
force, and the seizure in advance of the strongest positions in
the town, he succeeded in effecting his purpose. He eventually
ejected the inhabitants, and took entire possession of
the city; which, once in his power, he dismantled in so savage
and ruthless a manner as to preclude the least hope that it
might ever be restored. The reason of his acting in this
manner was, I believe, that Megalopolis and Stymphalus
were the only towns in which, during the vicissitudes of
that period, he never succeeded in obtaining a single partisan,
or inducing a single citizen to turn traitor. For the
passion for liberty and the loyalty of the Clitorians had been
stained by the baseness of one man, Thearces; whom the
Clitorians, with some reason, denied to be a native of their
city, asserting that he had been foisted in from Orchomenus,
and was the offspring of one of the foreign garrison there.</p>

<p><a name="b2_56" id="b2_56"><b>56.</b></a> For the history of the same period, with which we are
now engaged, there are two authorities, <span class="sidenote">Digression (to

and Phylarchus,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> whose opinions are opposed in
many points and their statements contradictory.
I think, therefore, it will be advantageous, or
rather necessary, since I follow Aratus in my account of
the Cleomenic war, to go into the question; and not by
any neglect on my part to suffer misstatements in historical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
writings to enjoy an authority equal to that of truth. The fact is
that the latter of these two writers has, throughout the whole of his
history, made statements at random and without discrimination.
It is not, however, necessary for me to criticise him on other
points on the present occasion, or to call him to strict account
concerning them; but such of his statements as relate to the
period which I have now in hand, that is the Cleomenic war, these
I must thoroughly sift. They will be quite sufficient to enable
us to form a judgment on the general spirit and ability with
which he approaches historical writing. It was his object to
bring into prominence the cruelty of Antigonus and the Macedonians,
<span class="sidenote">Mantinea.</span>as well as that of Aratus and the
Achaeans; and he accordingly asserts that, when
Mantinea fell into their hands, it was cruelly treated; and
that the most ancient and important of all the Arcadian
towns was involved in calamities so terrible as to move all
Greece to horror and tears. And being eager to stir the
hearts of his readers to pity, and to enlist their sympathies
by his story, he talks of women embracing, tearing their hair,
and exposing their breasts; and again of the tears and
lamentations of men and women, led off into captivity along
with their children and aged parents. And this he does again
and again throughout his whole history, by way of bringing the
terrible scene vividly before his readers. I say nothing of the
unworthiness and unmanliness of the course he has adopted:
let us only inquire what is essential and to the purpose in
history. Surely an historian&#8217;s object should not be to amaze
his readers by a series of thrilling anecdotes; nor should he
aim at producing speeches which <i>might</i> have been delivered,
nor study dramatic propriety in details like a writer of tragedy:
but his function is above all to record with fidelity what was
actually said or done, however commonplace it may be. For
the purposes of history and of the drama are not the same, but
widely opposed to each other. In the former the object is to
strike and delight by words as true to nature as possible; in
the latter to instruct and convince by genuine words and
deeds; in the former the effect is meant to be temporary, in
the latter permanent. In the former, again, the power of
carrying an audience is the chief excellence, because the object<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
is to create illusion; but in the latter the thing of primary
importance is truth, because the object is to benefit the
learner. And apart from these considerations, Phylarchus, in
most of the catastrophes which he relates, omits to suggest the
causes which gave rise to them, or the course of events which
led up to them: and without knowing these, it is impossible to
feel the due indignation or pity at anything which occurs. For
instance, everybody looks upon it as an outrage that the free
should be struck: still, if a man provokes it by an act of violence,
he is considered to have got no more than he deserved; and,
where it is done for correction and discipline, those who strike
free men are deemed worthy of honour and gratitude. Again,
the killing of a fellow-citizen is regarded as a heinous crime,
deserving the severest penalties: and yet it is notorious that the
man who kills a thief, or his wife&#8217;s paramour, is held guiltless;
while he who kills a traitor or tyrant in every country receives
honours and pre-eminence. And so in everything our final judgment
does not depend upon the mere things done, but upon their
causes and the views of the actors, according as these differ.</p>

<p><a name="b2_57" id="b2_57"><b>57.</b></a> Now the people of Mantinea had in the first instance
abandoned the league, and voluntarily submitted, first to
the Aetolians, and afterwards to Cleomenes. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;227.</span>
Being therefore, in accordance with this
policy, members of the Lacedaemonian community, in the
fourth year before the coming of Antigonus, their city was
forcibly taken possession of by the Achaeans owing to the
skilful plotting of Aratus. But on that occasion, so far from
being subjected to any severity for their act of treason, it
became a matter of general remark how promptly the feelings
of the conquerors and the conquered underwent a
revolution. As soon as he had got possession of the town,
Aratus issued orders to his own men that no one was to lay a
finger on anything that did not belong to him; and then,
having summoned the Mantineans to a meeting, he bade them
be of good cheer, and stay in their own houses; for that, as
long as they remained members of the league, their safety was
secured. On their part, the Mantineans, surprised at this
unlooked-for prospect of safety, immediately experienced a
universal revulsion of feeling. The very men against whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
they had a little while before been engaged in a war, in which
they had seen many of their kinsfolk killed, and no small
number grievously wounded, they now received into their
houses, and entertained as their guests, interchanging every
imaginable kindness with them. And naturally so. For I
believe that there never were men who met with more kindly
foes, or came out of a struggle with what seemed the most dreadful
disasters more scatheless, than did the Mantineans, owing
to the humanity of Aratus and the Achaeans towards them.</p>

<p><a name="b2_58" id="b2_58"><b>58.</b></a> But they still saw certain dangers ahead from intestine
disorders, and the hostile designs of the Aetolians and
Lacedaemonians; they subsequently, therefore, sent envoys
to the league asking for a guard for their town. The request
was granted: and three hundred of the league army were
selected by lot to form it. These men on whom the lot fell
started for Mantinea; and, abandoning their native cities and
their callings in life, remained there to protect the lives and
liberties of the citizens. Besides them, the league despatched
two hundred mercenaries, who joined the Achaean guard in
protecting the established constitution. But this state of
things did not last long: an insurrection broke out in the town,
and the Mantineans called in the aid of the Lacedaemonians;
delivered the city into their hands; and put to death the
garrison sent by the league. It would not be easy to
mention a grosser or blacker act of treachery. Even if they
resolved to utterly set at nought the gratitude they owed to,
and the friendship they had formed with, the league; they
ought at least to have spared these men, and to have let every
one of them depart under some terms or another: for this
much it is the custom by the law of nations to grant even to
foreign enemies. But in order to satisfy Cleomenes and the
Lacedaemonians of their fidelity in the policy of the hour, they
deliberately, and in violation of international law, consummated
a crime of the most impious description. To slaughter and
wreak vengeance on the men who had just before taken
their city, and refrained from doing them the least
harm, and who were at that very moment engaged in protecting
their lives and liberties,&mdash;can anything be imagined more
detestable? What punishment can be conceived to correspond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
with its enormity? If one suggests that they would be rightly
served by being sold into slavery, with their wives and children,
as soon as they were beaten in war; it may be answered that
this much is only what, by the laws of warfare, awaits even
those who have been guilty of no special act of impiety. They
deserved therefore to meet with a punishment even more
complete and heavy than they did; so that, even if what
Phylarchus mentions did happen to them, there was no reason
for the pity of Greece being bestowed on them: praise and
approval rather were due to those who exacted vengeance for
their impious crime. But since, as a matter of fact, nothing
worse befel the Mantineans than the plunder of their property
and the selling of their free citizens into slavery, this historian,
for the mere sake of a sensational story, has not only told a pure
lie, but an improbable lie. His wilful ignorance also was so supreme,
that he was unable to compare with this alleged cruelty
of the Achaeans the conduct of the same people in the case of
Tegea, which they took by force at the same period, and yet did
no injury to its inhabitants. And yet, if the natural cruelty of
the perpetrators was the sole cause of the severity to Mantinea,
it is to be presumed that Tegea would have been treated in the
same way. But if their treatment of Mantinea was an exception
to that of every other town, the necessary inference is that the
cause for their anger was exceptional also.</p>

<p><a name="b2_59" id="b2_59"><b>59.</b></a> Again Phylarchus says that Aristomachus the Argive,
a man of a most distinguished family, <span class="sidenote">Aristomachus.</span>who
had been despot of Argos, as his fathers had
been before him, upon falling into the hands of Antigonus
and the league &#8220;was hurried off to Cenchreae and there
racked to death,&mdash;an unparalleled instance of injustice and
cruelty.&#8221; But in this matter also our author preserves his
peculiar method. He makes up a story about certain
cries of this man, when he was on the rack, being heard
through the night by the neighbours: &#8220;some of whom,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;rushed to the house in their horror, or incredulity,
or indignation at the outrage.&#8221; As for the sensational story,
let it pass; I have said enough on that point. But I must
express my opinion that, even if Aristomachus had committed
no crime against the Achaeans besides, yet his whole life and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
his treason to his own country deserved the heaviest possible
punishment. And in order, forsooth, to enhance this man&#8217;s
reputation, and move his reader&#8217;s sympathies for his sufferings,
our historian remarks that he had not only been a tyrant
himself, but that his fathers had been so before him. It would
not be easy to bring a graver or more bitter charge against a
man than this: for the mere word &#8220;tyrant&#8221; involves the idea
of everything that is wickedest, and includes every injustice
and crime possible to mankind. And if Aristomachus endured
the most terrible tortures, as Phylarchus says, he yet would
not have been sufficiently punished for the crime of one day,
in which, when Aratus had effected an entrance into Argos
with the Achaean soldiers,&mdash;and after supporting the most
severe struggles and dangers for the freedom of its citizens, had
eventually been driven out, because the party within who were
in league with him had not ventured to stir, for fear of the
tyrant,&mdash;Aristomachus availed himself of the pretext of their
complicity with the irruption of the Achaeans to put to the rack
and execute eighty of the leading citizens, who were perfectly
innocent, in the presence of their relations. I pass by the
history of his whole life and the crimes of his ancestors; for
that would be too long a story.</p>

<p><a name="b2_60" id="b2_60"><b>60.</b></a> But this shows that we ought not to be indignant if
a man reaps as he has sown; but rather if he is allowed to
end his days in peace, without experiencing such retribution
at all. Nor ought we to accuse Antigonus or Aratus of crime,
for having racked and put to death a tyrant whom they had
captured in war: to have killed and wreaked vengeance on
whom, even in time of peace, would have brought praise and
honour to the doers from all right-minded persons.</p>

<p>But when, in addition to these crimes, he was guilty also of
treachery to the league, what shall we say that he deserved?
The facts of the case are these. He abdicated his sovereignty
of Argos shortly before, finding himself in difficulties, owing to
the state of affairs brought on by the death of Demetrius. He
was, however, protected by the clemency and generosity of the
league; and, much to his own surprise, was left unmolested.
For the Achaean government not only secured him an
indemnity for all crimes committed by him while despot, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
admitted him as a member of the league, and invested him
with the highest office in it,&mdash;that, namely, of Commander-in-Chief
and Strategus.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> All these favours he immediately forgot,
as soon as his hopes were a little raised by the Cleomenic war;
and at a crisis of the utmost importance he withdrew his
native city, as well as his own personal adhesion, from the
league, and attached them to its enemies. For such an act
of treason what he deserved was not to be racked under cover
of night at Cenchreae, and then put to death, as Phylarchus
says: he ought to have been taken from city to city in the
Peloponnese, and to have ended his life only after exemplary
torture in each of them. And yet the only severity that this
guilty wretch had to endure was to be drowned in the sea by
order of the officers at Cenchreae.</p>

<p><a name="b2_61" id="b2_61"><b>61.</b></a> There is another illustration of this writer&#8217;s manner
to be found in his treatment of the cases of
Mantinea and Megalopolis. <span class="sidenote">Megalopolis.</span>The misfortunes
of the former he has depicted with his usual exaggeration and
picturesqueness: apparently from the notion, that it is the
peculiar function of an historian to select for special mention
only such actions as are conspicuously bad. But about
the noble conduct of the Megalopolitans at that same period
he has not said a word: as though it were the province of history
to deal with crimes rather than with instances of just and
noble conduct; or as though his readers would be less improved
by the record of what is great and worthy of imitation, than by
that of such deeds as are base and fit only to be avoided. For
instance, he has told us clearly enough how Cleomenes took
the town, preserved it from damage, and forthwith sent couriers
to the Megalopolitans in Messene with a despatch, offering
them the safe enjoyment of their country if they would throw
in their lot with him;&mdash;and his object in telling all this is
to enhance the magnanimity and moderation of Cleomenes
towards his enemies. Nay, he has gone farther, and told us
how the people of Megalopolis would not allow the letter to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
be read to the end, and were not far from stoning the bearers
of it. Thus much he does tell us. But the sequel to this, so
appropriate to an historian,&mdash;the commendation, I mean, and
honourable mention of their noble conduct,&mdash;this he has altogether
left out. And yet he had an opportunity ready to his
hand. For if we view with approval the conduct of a people
who merely by their declarations and votes support a war in
behalf of friends and allies; while to those who go so far as to
endure the devastation of their territory, and a siege of their
town, we give not only praise but active gratitude: what
must be our estimate of the people of Megalopolis?
Must it not be of the most exalted character? First of all,
they allowed their territory to be at the mercy of Cleomenes,
and then consented to be entirely deprived of their city, rather
than be false to the league: and, finally, in spite of an unexpected
chance of recovering it, they deliberately preferred the
loss of their territory, the tombs of their ancestors, their temples,
their homes and property, of everything in fact which men
value most, to forfeiting their faith to their allies. No nobler
action has ever been, or ever will be performed; none to which
an historian could better draw his reader&#8217;s attention. For
what could be a higher incentive to good faith, or the maintenance
of frank and permanent relations between states?
But of all this Phylarchus says not a word, being, as it
seems to me, entirely blind as to all that is noblest and best
suited to be the theme of an historian.</p>

<p><a name="b2_62" id="b2_62"><b>62.</b></a> He does, however, state in the course of his narrative
that, from the spoils of Megalopolis, six thousand
talents fell to the Lacedaemonians, <span class="sidenote">and its wealth.</span>of
which two thousand, according to custom, were given to
Cleomenes. This shows, to begin with, an astounding ignorance
of the ordinary facts as to the resources of Greece:
a knowledge which above all others should be possessed
by historians. I am not of course now speaking of the
period in which the Peloponnese had been ruined by the
Macedonian kings, and still more completely by a long continuance
of intestine struggles; but of our own times, in
which it is believed, by the establishment of its unity, to be
enjoying the highest prosperity of which it is capable. Still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
even at this period, if you could collect all the movable property
of the whole Peloponnese (leaving out the value of slaves),
it would be impossible to get so large a sum of money together.
That I speak on good grounds and not at random will appear
from the following fact. Every one has read that when the
Athenians, in conjunction with the Thebans, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;378.</span>
entered upon the war with the Lacedaemonians,
and despatched an army of twenty thousand men, and manned
a hundred triremes, they resolved to supply the expenses of
the war by the assessment of a property tax; and accordingly
had a valuation taken, not only of the whole land of
Attica and the houses in it, but of all other property: but yet
the value returned fell short of six thousand talents by two
hundred and fifty; which will show that what I have just said
about the Peloponnese is not far wide of the mark. But at
this period the most exaggerated estimate could scarcely give
more than three hundred talents, as coming from Megalopolis
itself; for it is acknowledged that most of the inhabitants, free
and slaves, escaped to Messene. But the strongest confirmation
of my words is the case of Mantinea, which, as he himself
observes, was second to no Arcadian city in wealth and numbers.
Though it was surrendered after a siege, so that no one
could escape, and no property could without great difficulty be
concealed; yet the value of the whole spoil of the town, including
the price of the captives sold, amounted at this same
period to only three hundred talents.</p>

<p><a name="b2_63" id="b2_63"><b>63.</b></a> But a more astonishing misstatement remains to be remarked.
In the course of his history of this
war, <span class="sidenote">Ptolemy
Euergetes and
Cleomenes.</span>
Phylarchus asserts &#8220;that about ten days
before the battle an ambassador came from
Ptolemy announcing to Cleomenes, that the king declined to
continue to support him with supplies, and advised him to make
terms with Antigonus. And that when this message had been
delivered to Cleomenes, he made up his mind that he had
better put his fortune to the supreme test as soon as possible,
before his forces learnt about this message, because he
could not hope to provide the soldiers&#8217; pay from his own resources.&#8221;
But if he had at that very time become the master
of six thousand talents, he would have been better supplied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
than Ptolemy himself. And as for war with Antigonus, if he
had become master of only three hundred talents, he would
have been able to continue it without any difficulty. But the
writer states two inconsistent propositions&mdash;that Cleomenes
depended wholly on Ptolemy for money: and that he at the
same time had become master of that enormous sum. Is this
not irrational, and grossly careless besides? I might mention
many instances of a similar kind, not only in his account of
this period, but throughout his whole work; but I think for
my present purpose enough has been said.</p>

<p><a name="b2_64" id="b2_64"><b>64.</b></a> Megalopolis having fallen, then, Antigonus spent the
winter at Argos. But at the approach of spring
Cleomenes collected his army, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;222.
Cleomenes invades
Argos.</span>
addressed a
suitable exhortation to them, and led them into
the Argive territory. Most people thought this a hazardous
and foolhardy step, because the places at which the frontier
was crossed were strongly fortified; but those who were
capable of judging regarded the measure as at once safe and
prudent. For seeing that Antigonus had dismissed his forces,
he reckoned on two things,&mdash;there would be no one to resist
him, and therefore he would run no risk; and when the
Argives found that their territory was being laid waste up to
their walls, they would be certain to be roused to anger and to
lay the blame upon Antigonus: therefore, if on the one hand
Antigonus, unable to bear the complaints of the populace, were
to sally forth and give him battle with his present forces, Cleomenes
felt sure of an easy victory; but if on the other hand
Antigonus refused to alter his plans, and kept persistently aloof,
he believed that he would be able to effect a safe retreat
home, after succeeding by this expedition in terrifying his
enemies and inspiring his own forces with courage. And this
was the actual result. For as the devastation of the country
went on, crowds began to collect and abuse Antigonus: but
like a wise general and king, he refused to allow any consideration
to outweigh that of sound strategy, and persisted in remaining
inactive. Accordingly Cleomenes, in pursuance of his
plan, having terrified his enemies and inspired courage in his
own army for the coming struggle, returned home unmolested.</p>

<p><a name="b2_65" id="b2_65"><b>65.</b></a> Summer having now come, and the Macedonian and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Achaean soldiers having assembled from their winter quarters,
Antigonus moved his army, along with his
allies, into Laconia. <span class="sidenote">The summer
campaign.
The army of
Antigonus.</span>The main force consisted
of ten thousand Macedonians for the phalanx,
three thousand light armed, and three hundred
cavalry. With these were a thousand Agraei; the same number
of Gauls; three thousand mercenary infantry, and three
hundred cavalry; picked troops of the Achaeans, three
thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry; and a thousand
Megalopolitans armed in the Macedonian manner, under the
command of Cercidas of Megalopolis. Of the allies there were
two thousand infantry, and two hundred cavalry, from Boeotia;
a thousand infantry and fifty cavalry from Epirus; the same
number from Acarnania; and sixteen hundred from Illyria, under
the command of Demetrius of Pharos. The whole amounted
to twenty-eight thousand infantry and twelve hundred cavalry.</p>

<p>Cleomenes had expected the attack, and had secured the
passes into the country by posting garrisons, <span class="sidenote">The position of
Cleomenes at
Sellasia.</span>
digging trenches, and felling trees; while he
took up position at a place called Sellasia, with
an army amounting to twenty thousand, having calculated that
the invading forces would take that direction: which turned out
to be the case. This pass lies between two hills, called
respectively Evas and Olympus, and the road to Sparta follows
the course of the river Oenus. Cleomenes strengthened both
these hills by lines of fortification, consisting of trench and
palisade. On Evas he posted the perioeci and allies, under
the command of his brother Eucleidas; while he himself held
Olympus with the Lacedaemonians and mercenaries. On
the level ground along the river he stationed his cavalry, with
a division of his mercenaries, on both sides of the road.
When Antigonus arrived, he saw at once the strength of the
position, and the skill with which Cleomenes had selected the
different branches of his army to occupy the points of vantage,
so that the whole aspect of the position was like that of
skilled soldiers drawn up ready for a charge. For no preparation
for attack or defence had been omitted; but everything
was in order, either for offering battle with effect, or for
holding an almost unassailable position.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b2_66" id="b2_66"><b>66.</b></a> The sight of these preparations decided Antigonus not
to make an immediate attack upon the position, or rashly hazard
an engagement. He pitched his camp a short distance from it,
covering his front by the stream called Gorgylus, and there remained
for some days; informing himself by reconnaissances of
the peculiarities of the ground and the character of the troops,
and at the same time endeavouring by feigned movements to
elicit the intentions of the enemy. But he could never find an
unguarded point, or one where the troops were not entirely on
the alert, for Cleomenes was always ready at a moment&#8217;s notice
to be at any point that was attacked. He therefore gave up
all thoughts of attacking the position; and finally an understanding
was come to between him and Cleomenes to bring
the matter to the decision of battle. And, indeed, Fortune
had there brought into competition two commanders equally
endowed by nature with military skill. To face the division
of the enemy on Evas Antigonus stationed his Macedonian
hoplites with brazen shields, and the Illyrians, drawn up in
alternate lines, under the command of Alexander, son of
Acmetus, and Demetrius of Pharos, respectively. Behind
them he placed the Acarnanians and Cretans, and behind
them again were two thousand Achaeans to act as a reserve.
His cavalry, on the banks of the river Oenous, were posted
opposite the enemy&#8217;s cavalry, under the command of Alexander,
and flanked by a thousand Achaean infantry and the
same number of Megalopolitans. Antigonus himself determined
to lead his mercenaries and Macedonian troops in
person against the division on Olympus commanded by Cleomenes.
Owing to the narrowness of the ground, the Macedonians
were arranged in a double phalanx, one close behind the
other, while the mercenaries were placed in front of them. It
was arranged that the Illyrians, who had bivouacked in full
order during the previous night along the river Gorgylus, close
to the foot of Evas, were to begin their assault on the hill when
they saw a flag of linen raised from the direction of Olympus;
and that the Megalopolitans and cavalry should do the same
when the king raised a scarlet flag.</p>

<p><a name="b2_67" id="b2_67"><b>67.</b></a> The moment for beginning the battle had come: the
signal was given to the Illyrians, and the word passed by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
officers to their men to do their duty, and in a moment they
started into view of the enemy and began assaulting
the hill. <span class="sidenote">Battle of
Sellasia.</span>
But the light-armed troops who were
stationed with Cleomenes&#8217;s cavalry, observing
that the Achaean lines were not covered by any other troops
behind them, charged them on the rear; and thus reduced the
division while endeavouring to carry the hill of Evas to a state of
great peril,&mdash;being met as they were on their front by Eucleidas
from the top of the hill, <span class="sidenote">Philopoemen&#8217;s
presence of mind.</span>
and being charged
and vigorously attacked by the light-armed
mercenaries on their rear. It was at this point
that Philopoemen of Megalopolis, with a clear understanding
of the situation and a foresight of what would happen,
vainly endeavoured to point out the certain result to his
superior officers. They disregarded him for his want of
experience in command and his extreme youth; and, accordingly
he acted for himself, and cheering on the men of his
own city, made a vigorous charge on the enemy. This effected
a diversion; for the light-armed mercenaries, who were engaged
in harassing the rear of the party ascending Evas, hearing the
shouting and seeing the cavalry engaged, abandoned their
attack upon this party and hurried back to their original position
to render assistance to the cavalry. The result was that
the division of Illyrians, Macedonians, and the rest who were
advancing with them, no longer had their attention diverted by
an attack upon their rear, and so continued their advance
upon the enemy with high spirits and renewed confidence. And
this afterwards caused it to be acknowledged that to Philopoemen
was due the honour of the success against Eucleidas.</p>

<p><a name="b2_68" id="b2_68"><b>68.</b></a> It is clear that Antigonus at any rate entertained that
opinion, for after the battle he asked Alexander, the commander
of the cavalry, with the view of convicting him of his
shortcoming, &#8220;Why he had engaged before the signal was
given?&#8221; And upon Alexander answering that &#8220;He had not
done so, but that a young officer from Megalopolis had presumed
to anticipate the signal, contrary to his wish:&#8221; Antigonus
replied, &#8220;That young man acted like a good general in grasping
the situation; you, general, were the youngster.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Eucleidas ought to have done, when he saw the enemy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>&#8217;s
lines advancing, was to have rushed down at once upon them;
thrown their ranks into disorder; and then retired himself, step
by step, to continually higher ground into a safe position: for
by thus breaking them up and depriving them, to begin with,
of the advantages of their peculiar armour and disposition, he
would have secured the victory by the superiority of his position.
But he did the very opposite of all this, and thereby forfeited
the advantages of the ground. As though victory were
assured, he kept his original position on the summit of the
hill, with the view of catching the enemy at as great an elevation
as possible, that their flight might be all the longer over
steep and precipitous ground. The result, as might have been
anticipated, was exactly the reverse. <span class="sidenote">Defeat of
Eucleidas.</span>
For he left himself no
place of retreat, and by allowing the enemy to
reach his position, unharmed and in unbroken
order, he was placed at the disadvantage of having
to give them battle on the very summit of the hill; and so,
as soon as he was forced by the weight of their heavy armour
and their close order to give any ground, it was immediately
occupied by the Illyrians; while his own men were obliged to
take lower ground, because they had no space for man&oelig;uvring
on the top. The result was not long in arriving: they suffered a
repulse, which the difficult and precipitous nature of the ground
over which they had to retire turned into a disastrous flight.</p>

<p><a name="b2_69" id="b2_69"><b>69.</b></a> Simultaneously with these events the cavalry engagement
was also being brought to a decision; in which all the
Achaean cavalry, and especially Philopoemen, fought with
conspicuous gallantry, for to them it was a contest for freedom.
Philopoemen himself had his horse killed under him, and while
fighting accordingly on foot received a severe wound through
both his thighs. <span class="sidenote">Defeat of
Cleomenes.</span>Meanwhile the two kings
on the other hill Olympus began by bringing
their light-armed troops and mercenaries into
action, of which each of them had five thousand. Both the
kings and their entire armies had a full view of this action,
which was fought with great gallantry on both sides: the
charges taking place sometimes in detachments, and at other
times along the whole line, and an eager emulation being
displayed between the several ranks, and even between in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>dividuals.
But when Cleomenes saw that his brother&#8217;s division
was retreating, and that the cavalry in the low ground were
on the point of doing the same, alarmed at the prospect of
an attack at all points at once, he was compelled to demolish
the palisade in his front, and to lead out his whole force in
line by one side of his position. A recall was sounded on
the bugle for the light-armed troops of both sides, who were
on the ground between the two armies: and the phalanxes
shouting their war cries, and with spears couched, charged
each other. Then a fierce struggle arose: the Macedonians
sometimes slowly giving ground and yielding to the superior
courage of the soldiers of Sparta, and at another time the
Lacedaemonians being forced to give way before the overpowering
weight of the Macedonian phalanx. At length
Antigonus ordered a charge in close order and in double
phalanx; the enormous weight of this peculiar formation proved
sufficient to finally dislodge the Lacedaemonians from their
strongholds, and they fled in disorder and suffering severely as
they went. Cleomenes himself, with a guard of cavalry,
effected his retreat to Sparta: but the same night he went
down to Gythium, where all preparations for crossing the
sea had been made long before in case of mishap, and with
his friends sailed to Alexandria.</p>

<p><a name="b2_70" id="b2_70"><b>70.</b></a> Having surprised and taken Sparta, Antigonus treated
the citizens with magnanimity and humanity; and after re-establishing
their ancient constitution, he left the town in
a few days, on receiving intelligence that the Illyrians had
invaded Macedonia and were laying waste the country.
This was an instance of the fantastic way in which Fortune
decides the most important matters. For if Cleomenes had
only put off the battle for a few days, or if when he returned
to Sparta he had only held out for a brief space of time, he
would have saved his crown.</p>

<p>As it was, Antigonus after going to Tegea and restoring
its constitution, arrived on the second day at
Argos, at the very time of the Nemean games. <span class="sidenote">Death of
Antigonus Doson,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
Having at this assembly received every mark of
immortal honour and glory at the hands of the Achaean
community, as well as of the several states, he made all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
haste to reach Macedonia. He found the Illyrians still in
the country, and forced them to give him battle, in which,
though he proved entirely successful, he exerted himself to
such a pitch in shouting encouragement to his men, that he
ruptured a bloodvessel, and fell into an illness which terminated
shortly in his death. He was a great loss to the Greeks,
whom he had inspired with good hopes, not only by his support
in the field, but still more by his character and good
principles. He left the kingdom of Macedonia to Philip, son
of Demetrius.</p>

<p><a name="b2_71" id="b2_71"><b>71.</b></a> My reason for writing about this war at such length,
was the advisability, or rather necessity, in view of the general
purpose of my history, of making clear the relations existing
between Macedonia and Greece at a time which coincides
with the period of which I am about to treat.</p>

<p>Just about the same time, by the death of Euergetes,
Ptolemy Philopator succeeded to the throne of Egypt. At the
same period died Seleucus, son of that Seleucus who had the
double surnames of Callinicus and Pogon: he was succeeded
on the throne of Syria by his brother Antiochus. The deaths of
these three sovereigns&mdash;Antigonus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus&mdash;fell
in the same Olympiad, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;284-280.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;224-220.</span>
as was the case with the
three immediate successors to Alexander the
Great,&mdash;Seleucus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus,&mdash;for
the latter all died in the 124th Olympiad, and the former
in the 139th.</p>

<p>I may now fitly close this book. I have completed the
introduction and laid the foundation on which my history
must rest. I have shown when, how, and why the Romans,
after becoming supreme in Italy, began to aim at dominion
outside of it, and to dispute with the Carthaginians the dominion
of the sea. I have at the same time explained the state of
Greece, Macedonia, and Carthage at this epoch. I have now
arrived at the period which I originally marked out,&mdash;that
namely in which the Greeks were on the point of beginning
the Social, the Romans the Hannibalic war, and the kings in
Asia the war for the possession of Coele-Syria. The termination
therefore of the wars just described, and the death of the
princes engaged in them, forms a natural period to this book.</p>

<h2>BOOK III</h2>

<p><a name="b3_1" id="b3_1"><b>1.</b></a> <span class="smcap">I stated</span> in my first book that my work was to start from
the Social war, the Hannibalian war, and the war for the
possession of Coele-Syria. In the same book I stated my
reasons for devoting my first two books to a sketch of the
period preceding those events. I will now, after a few
prefatory remarks as to the scope of my own work, address
myself to giving a complete account of these wars, the causes
which led to them, and which account for the proportions to
which they attained.</p>

<p>The one aim and object, then, of all that I have undertaken
to write is to show how, when, and why all the
known parts of the world fell under the
dominion of Rome. <span class="sidenote">A summary of
the work from
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220 to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;168.</span>
Now as this great event
admits of being exactly dated as to its beginning,
duration, and final accomplishment, I think it will
be advantageous to give, by way of preface, a summary statement
of the most important phases in it between the beginning
and the end. For I think I shall thus best secure to the
student an adequate idea of my whole plan, for as the comprehension
of the whole is a help to the understanding of
details, and the knowledge of details of great service to the
clear conception of the whole; believing that the best and
clearest knowledge is that which is obtained from a combination
of these, I will preface my whole history by a brief
summary of its contents.</p>

<p>I have already described its scope and limits. As to its
several parts, the first consists of the above mentioned wars,
while the conclusion or closing scene is the fall of the
Macedonian monarchy. The time included between these
limits is fifty-three years, and never has an equal space embraced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
events of such magnitude and importance.<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220-216.</span> In describing
them I shall start from the 140th Olympiad and
shall arrange my exposition in the following order:</p>

<p><a name="b3_2" id="b3_2"><b>2.</b></a> First I shall indicate the causes of the Punic or
Hannibalian war: and shall have to describe
how the Carthaginians entered Italy; <span class="sidenote">1. The cause and
course of the
Hannibalian war.</span>
broke up
the Roman power there; made the Romans
tremble for their safety and the very soil of their country;
and contrary to all calculation acquired a good prospect of
surprising Rome itself.</p>

<p>I shall next try to make it clear how in the same period
Philip of Macedon, after finishing his war with <span class="sidenote">2. Macedonian
treaty with Carthage,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216.</span>
the Aetolians, and subsequently settling the
affairs of Greece, entered upon a design of
forming an offensive and defensive alliance with Carthage.</p>

<p>Then I shall tell how Antiochus and Ptolemy Philopator
first quarrelled and finally went to war with <span class="sidenote">3. Syrian war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218.</span>
each other for the possession of Coele-Syria.</p>

<p>Next how the Rhodians and Prusias went to war with the
Byzantines, and compelled them to desist from <span class="sidenote">4. Byzantine war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
exacting dues from ships sailing into the Pontus.</p>

<p>At this point I shall pause in my narrative to introduce a
disquisition upon the Roman Constitution, <span class="sidenote">First digression
on the Roman
Constitution.</span>
in
which I shall show that its peculiar character
contributed largely to their success, not only in
reducing all Italy to their authority, and in acquiring a
supremacy over the Iberians and Gauls besides, but also at
last, after their conquest of Carthage, to their conceiving the
idea of universal dominion.</p>

<p>Along with this I shall introduce another <span class="sidenote">Second on Hiero
of Syracuse.</span>
digression on the fall of Hiero of Syracuse.</p>

<p>After these digressions will come the disturbances in
Egypt; how, after the death of King Ptolemy, <span class="sidenote">5. The attempted
partition of the
dominions of Ptolemy
Epiphanes,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;204.</span>
Antiochus and Philip entered into a compact
for the partition of the dominions of that
monarch&#8217;s infant son. I shall describe their
treacherous dealings, Philip laying hands upon
the islands of the Aegean, and Caria and Samos, Antiochus
upon Coele-Syria and Phoenicia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b3_3" id="b3_3"><b>3.</b></a> Next, after a summary recapitulation of the proceedings of
the Carthaginians and Romans in Iberia, Libya, <span class="sidenote">6. War with
Philip, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;201-197.</span>
and Sicily, I shall, following the changes of
events, shift the scene of my story entirely to
Greece. Here I shall first describe the naval battles of Attalus
and the Rhodians against Philip; and the war between Philip
and Rome, the persons engaged, its circumstances, and result.</p>

<p>Next to this I shall have to record the wrath of the Aetolians,
in consequence of which they invited the aid of
Antiochus, and thereby gave rise to what is <span class="sidenote">7. Asiatic war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;192-191.</span>
called the Asiatic war against Rome and the
Achaean league. Having stated the causes of this war, and
described the crossing of Antiochus into Europe, I shall have
to show first in what manner he was driven from Greece;
secondly, how, being defeated in the war, he was forced to
cede all his territory west of Taurus; and thirdly, how the
Romans, after crushing the insolence of the Gauls, secured
undisputed possession of Asia, and freed all the nations on
the west of Taurus from the fear of barbarian inroads and
the lawless violence of the Gauls.</p>

<p>Next, after reviewing the disasters of the Aetolians and
Cephallenians, I shall pass to the wars waged <span class="sidenote">8. Gallic wars of
Eumenes and
Prusias.</span>
by Eumenes against Prusias and the Gauls; as
well as that carried on in alliance with Ariarathes
against Pharnaces.</p>

<p>Finally, after speaking of the unity and settlement of the
Peloponnese, and of the growth of the commonwealth
of Rhodes, I shall add a summary of <span class="sidenote">9. Union of the
Peloponnese.
Antiochus
Epiphanes in
Egypt. Fall of
the Macedonian
monarchy,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;188-168.</span>
my whole work, concluding by an account
of the expedition of Antiochus Epiphanes
against Egypt; of the war against Perseus;
and the destruction of the Macedonian
monarchy. Throughout the whole narrative it
will be shown how the policy adopted by the Romans in one
after another of these cases, as they arose, led to their eventual
conquest of the whole world.</p>

<p><a name="b3_4" id="b3_4"><b>4.</b></a> And if our judgment of individuals and constitutions,
for praise or blame, could be adequately formed from a simple
consideration of their successes or defeats, I must necessarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
have stopped at this point, and have concluded my history as
soon as I reached these last events in accordance with my
original plan. For at this point the fifty-three years were
coming to an end, and the progress of the Roman power had
arrived at its consummation. And, besides, by this time
the acknowledgment had been extorted from all that the
supremacy of Rome must be accepted, and her commands
obeyed. <span class="sidenote">The plan extended
to embrace
the period from
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;168-146.</span>
But in truth, judgments of either side
founded on the bare facts of success or failure
in the field are by no means final. It has
often happened that what seemed the most
signal successes have, from ill management, brought the
most crushing disasters in their train; while not unfrequently
the most terrible calamities, sustained with spirit,
have been turned to actual advantage. I am bound, therefore,
to add to my statement of facts a discussion on the
subsequent policy of the conquerors, and their administration
of their universal dominion: and again on the
various feelings and opinions entertained by other nations
towards their rulers. And I must also describe the tastes
and aims of the several nations, whether in their private
lives or public policy. The present generation will learn
from this whether they should shun or seek the rule
of Rome; and future generations will be taught whether to
praise and imitate, or to decry it. The usefulness of my
history, whether for the present or the future, will mainly lie
in this. For the end of a policy should not be, in the eyes
either of the actors or their historians, simply to conquer others
and bring all into subjection. Nor does any man of sense
go to war with his neighbours for the mere purpose of
mastering his opponents; nor go to sea for the mere sake of
the voyage; nor engage in professions and trades for the sole
purpose of learning them. In all these cases the objects are
invariably the pleasure, honour, or profit which are the results
of the several employments. Accordingly the object of this
work shall be to ascertain exactly what the position of the several
states was, after the universal conquest by which they fell under
the power of Rome, until the commotions and disturbances
which broke out at a later period. These I designed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
make the starting-point of what may almost be called a new
work, partly because of the greatness and surprising nature of
the events themselves, but chiefly because, in the case of most
of them, I was not only an eye-witness, but in some cases one
of the actors, and in others the chief director.</p>

<p><a name="b3_5" id="b3_5"><b>5.</b></a> The events I refer to are the wars of Rome against the
Celtiberians and Vaccaei; those of Carthage <span class="sidenote">A new departure;
the breaking-up
of the arrangement
made after
the fall of
Macedonia.
Wars of Carthage
against Massinissa;
and of
Rome against
the Celtiberians,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;155-150;
and against Carthage
(3d Punic
war, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;149-146).</span>
against Massinissa, king of Libya; and those
of Attalus and Prusias in Asia. Then also
Ariarathes, King of Cappadocia, having been
ejected from his throne by Orophernes through
the agency of King Demetrius, recovered his
ancestral power by the help of Attalus; while
Demetrius, son of Seleucus, after twelve years&#8217;
possession of the throne of Syria, was deprived
of it, and of his life at the same time, by a combination
of the other kings against him. Then
it was, too, that the Romans restored to their
country those Greeks who had been charged
with guilt in the matter of the war with Perseus, after formally
acquitting them of the crimes alleged against them. Not
long afterwards the same people turned their hands against
Carthage: at first with the intention of forcing its removal to
some other spot, but finally, for reasons to be afterwards
stated, with the resolution of utterly destroying it. Contemporaneous
with this came the renunciation by the Macedonians
of their friendship to Rome, and by the Lacedaemonians
of their membership of the Achaean league, to
which the disaster that befell all Greece alike owed its beginning
and end.</p>

<p>This is my purpose: but its fulfilment must depend upon
whether Fortune protracts my life to the necessary length. I am
persuaded, however, that, even if the common human destiny
does overtake me, this theme will not be allowed to lie idle
for want of competent men to handle it; for there are many
besides myself who will readily undertake its completion.
But having given the heads of the most remarkable events,
with the object of enabling the reader to grasp the general
scope of my history as well as the arrangement of its several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
parts, I must now, remembering my original plan, go back to
the point at which my history starts.</p>

<p><a name="b3_6" id="b3_6"><b>6.</b></a> Some historians of the Hannibalian war, when they wish
to point out to us the causes of this contest <span class="sidenote">The origin of the
2d Punic war;</span>
between Rome and Carthage, allege first the
siege of Saguntum by the Carthaginians, and,
secondly, their breach of treaty by crossing the river called by
the natives the Iber. But though I should call these the
first actions in the war, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;334,</span>
I cannot admit them
to be its causes. One might just as well say
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;192,</span>
that the crossing of Alexander the Great into Asia was the
<i>cause</i> of the Persian war, and the descent of
Antiochus upon Demetrias the <i>cause</i> of his war
with Rome. In neither would it be a probable or true statement.
In the first case, this action of Alexander&#8217;s could not be
called the cause of a war, for which both he and his father
Philip in his lifetime had made elaborate preparations: and in
the second case, we know that the Aetolian league had done
the same, with a view to a war with Rome, before Antiochus
came upon the scene. Such definitions are only worthy of men
who cannot distinguish between a first overt act and a cause or
pretext; and who do not perceive that a <i>cause</i> is the first in
a series of events of which such an overt act is the last. I
shall therefore regard the first attempt to put into execution
what had already been determined as a &#8220;beginning,&#8221; but I
shall look for &#8220;causes&#8221; in the motives which suggested such
action and the policy which dictated it; for it is by these, and
the calculations to which they give rise, that men are led to
decide upon a particular line of conduct. The soundness of
this method will be proved by the following considerations.
The true causes and origin of the invasion of Persia by Alexander
are patent to everybody. They were, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;401-400,</span>
first, the return march of the Greeks under
Xenophon through the country from the upper Satrapies;
in the course of which, though throughout Asia all the populations
were hostile, not a single barbarian ventured to face
them: <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;396-394,</span>
secondly, the invasion of Asia by the
Spartan king Agesilaus, in which, though he was
obliged by troubles in Greece to return in the middle of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
expedition without effecting his object, he yet found no resistance
of any importance or adequacy. It was these circumstances
which convinced Philip of the cowardice and inefficiency
of the Persians; and comparing them with his own high state
of efficiency for war, and that of his Macedonian subjects, and
placing before his eyes the splendour of the rewards to be
gained by such a war, and the popularity which it would bring
him in Greece, he seized on the pretext of avenging the injuries
done by Persia to Greece, and determined with great
eagerness to undertake this war; and was in fact at the time
of his death engaged in making every kind of preparation for it.</p>

<p>Here we have the <i>cause</i> and the <i>pretext</i> of the Persian war.
Alexander&#8217;s expedition into Asia was the <i>first action</i> in it.</p>

<p><a name="b3_7" id="b3_7"><b>7.</b></a> So too of the war of Antiochus with Rome. The <i>cause</i>
was evidently the exasperation of the Aetolians, <span class="sidenote">and of the war
with Antiochus.</span>
who, thinking that they had been slighted in
a number of instances at the end of the war
with Philip, not only called in the aid of Antiochus, but resolved
to go to every extremity in satisfying the anger which
the events of that time had aroused in them. This was the
<i>cause</i>. As for the <i>pretext</i>, it was the liberation of Greece,
which they went from city to city with Antiochus proclaiming,
without regard to reason or truth; while the <i>first act</i> in the
war was the descent of Antiochus upon Demetrias.</p>

<p>My object in enlarging upon this distinction is not to attack
the historians in question, but to rectify the ideas of the
studious. A physician can do no good to the sick who does
not know the causes of their ailments; nor can a statesman
do any good who is unable to conceive the manner, cause, and
source of the events with which he has from time to time to deal.
Surely the former could not be expected to institute a suitable
system of treatment for the body; nor the latter to grapple with
the exigencies of the situation, without possessing this knowledge
of its elements. There is nothing, therefore, which we
ought to be more alive to, and to seek for, than the causes of
every event which occurs. For the most important results
are often produced by trifles; and it is invariably easier to
apply remedial measures at the beginning, before things have
got beyond the stage of conception and intention.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b3_8" id="b3_8"><b>8.</b></a> Now the Roman annalist Fabius asserts that the cause
of the Hannibalian war, besides the injury inflicted
upon Saguntum, <span class="sidenote">The credibility of
Fabius Pictor.</span>
was the encroaching and
ambitious spirit of Hasdrubal. &#8220;Having secured
great power in Iberia, he returned to Libya with the design
of destroying the constitution and reducing Carthage to a
despotism. But the leading statesmen, getting timely warning
of his intention, banded themselves together and successfully
opposed him. Suspecting this Hasdrubal retired from Libya,
and thenceforth governed Iberia entirely at his own will without
taking any account whatever of the Carthaginian Senate.
This policy had had in Hannibal from his earliest youth a
zealous supporter and imitator; and when he succeeded to
the command in Iberia he continued it: and accordingly, even
in the case of this war with Rome, was acting on his own
authority and contrary to the wish of the Carthaginians; for
none of the men of note in Carthage approved of his attack
upon Saguntum.&#8221; This is the statement of Fabius, who goes
on to say, that &#8220;after the capture of that city an embassy
arrived in Carthage from Rome demanding that Hannibal
should be given up on pain of a declaration of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now what answer could Fabius have given if we had put
the following question to him? &#8220;What better chance or
opportunity could the Carthaginians have had of combining
justice and interest? According to your own account they
disliked the proceeding of Hannibal: why did they not submit
to the demands of Rome by surrendering the author of the
injury; and thus get rid of the common enemy of the state
without the odium of doing it themselves, and secure the
safety of their territory by ridding themselves of the threatened
war&mdash;all of which they could have effected by merely passing
a decree?&#8221; If this question were put, I say, it would admit
of no answer. The fact is that, so far from doing anything of
the sort, they maintained the war in accordance with Hannibal&#8217;s
policy for seventeen years; and refused to make terms
until, at the end of a most determined struggle, they found
their own city and persons in imminent danger of destruction.</p>

<p><a name="b3_9" id="b3_9"><b>9.</b></a> I do not allude to Fabius and his annals from any fear of
their wearing such an air of probability in themselves as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
gain any credit,&mdash;for the fact is that his assertions are so contrary
to reason, that it does not need any argument of mine to
help his readers to perceive it,&mdash;but I wished to warn those
who take up his books not to be misled by the authority of his
name, but to be guided by facts. For there is a certain class
of readers in whose eyes the personality of the writer is of more
account than what he says. They look to the fact that
Fabius was a contemporary and a member of the Senate, and
assume without more ado that everything he says may be
trusted. My view, however, is that we ought not to hold the
authority of this writer lightly: yet at the same time that we
should not regard it as all-sufficient; but in reading his writings
should test them by a reference to the facts themselves.</p>

<p>This is a digression from my immediate subject, which is
the war between Carthage and Rome. <span class="sidenote">The Hannibalian
or 2nd Punic war.
First cause.</span>
The
cause of this war we must reckon to be the
exasperation of Hamilcar, surnamed Barcas, the
father of Hannibal. The result of the war in Sicily had not
broken the spirit of that commander. He regarded himself as
unconquered; for the troops at Eryx which he commanded
were still sound and undismayed: and though he yielded so
far as to make a treaty, it was a concession to the exigencies
of the times brought on by the defeat of the Carthaginians at
sea. But he never relaxed in his determined purpose of revenge;
and, had it not been for the mutiny of the mercenaries
at Carthage, he would at once have sought and made
another occasion for bringing about a war, as far as he was
able to do so: as it was, he was preoccupied by the domestic
war, and had to give his attention entirely to that.</p>

<p><a name="b3_10" id="b3_10"><b>10.</b></a> When the Romans, at the conclusion of this mercenary
war, proclaimed war with Carthage, the latter at
first was inclined to resist at all hazards, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;238.
Bk. i. ch. 88.
Second cause.</span>
because
the goodness of her cause gave her hopes
of victory,&mdash;as I have shown in my former book, without which
it would be impossible to understand adequately either this or
what is to follow. The Romans, however, would not listen to
anything: and the Carthaginians therefore yielded to the force
of circumstances; and though feeling bitterly aggrieved, yet being
quite unable to do anything, evacuated Sardinia, and consented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
to pay a sum of twelve hundred talents, in addition to the
former indemnity paid them, on condition of avoiding the
war at that time. This is the second and the most important
cause of the subsequent war. For Hamilcar, having this public
grievance in addition to his private feelings of anger, as soon as
he had secured his country&#8217;s safety by reducing the rebellious
mercenaries, set at once about securing the Carthaginian
power in Iberia with the intention of using it as a base of
operations against Rome. <span class="sidenote">Third cause.</span>
So that I record as a
third cause of the war the Carthaginian success
in Iberia: for it was the confidence inspired by their forces there
which encouraged them to embark upon it. It would be easy
to adduce other facts to show that Hamilcar, though he had
been dead ten years at its commencement, largely contributed
to bring about the second Punic war, but what I am about to
say will be sufficient to establish the fact.</p>

<p><a name="b3_11" id="b3_11"><b>11.</b></a> When, after his final defeat by the Romans, Hannibal
had at last quitted his country and was staying
at the court of Antiochus, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal&#8217;s oath.</span>
the warlike attitude
of the Aetolian league induced the Romans to send ambassadors
to Antiochus, that they might be informed of the king&#8217;s
intentions. These ambassadors found that Antiochus was inclined
to the Aetolian alliance, and was eager for war with
Rome; <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;195.</span>
they accordingly paid great court to
Hannibal with a view of bringing him into
suspicion with the king. And in this they entirely succeeded.
As time went on the king became ever more and more suspicious
of Hannibal, until at length an opportunity occurred
for an explanation of the alienation that had been thus secretly
growing up between them. Hannibal then defended himself
at great length, but without success, until at last he made the
following statement: <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;238.</span>
&#8220;When my father was
about to go on his Iberian expedition I was
nine years old: and as he was offering the sacrifice to Zeus I
stood near the altar. The sacrifice successfully performed,
my father poured the libation and went through the
usual ritual. He then bade all the other worshippers stand a
little back, and calling me to him asked me affectionately
whether I wished to go with him on his expedition. Upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
my eagerly assenting, and begging with boyish enthusiasm to
be allowed to go, he took me by the right hand and led me up
to the altar, and bade me lay my hand upon the victim and
swear that I would never be friends with Rome. So long,
then, Antiochus, as your policy is one of hostility to Rome,
you may feel quite secure of having in me a most thorough-going
supporter. But if ever you make terms or friendship
with her, then you need not wait for any slander to make you
distrust me and be on your guard against me; for there is
nothing in my power that I would not do against her.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b3_12" id="b3_12"><b>12.</b></a> Antiochus listened to this story, and being convinced
that it was told with genuine feeling and sincerity, gave up all
his suspicions. And we, too, must regard this as an unquestionable
proof of the animosity of Hamilcar and of the aim of
his general policy; which, indeed, is also proved by facts.
For he inspired his son-in-law Hasdrubal and his son Hannibal
with a bitterness of resentment against Rome which
nothing could surpass. Hasdrubal, indeed, was prevented by
death from showing the full extent of his purpose; but time
gave Hannibal abundant opportunity to manifest the hatred of
Rome which he had inherited from his father.</p>

<p>The most important thing, then, for statesmen to observe is
the motives of those who lay aside old enmities or form new
friendships; and to ascertain when their consent to treaties is
a mere concession to the necessities of the hour, and when it
is the indication of a real consciousness of defeat. In the former
case they must be on their guard against such people lying in
wait for an opportunity; while in the latter they may unhesitatingly
impose whatever injunctions are necessary, in full
reliance on the genuineness of their feelings whether as subjects
or friends. So much for the causes of the war. I will
now relate the first actions in it.</p>

<p><a name="b3_13" id="b3_13"><b>13.</b></a> The Carthaginians were highly incensed by their loss
of Sicily, but their resentment was heightened still more, as I
have said, by the transaction as to Sardinia, and by the addition
recently made to their tribute. Accordingly, when the
greater part of Iberia had fallen into their power, they were on
the alert to seize any opportunity that presented itself of retaliating
upon Rome. At the death of Hasdrubal, to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
they had committed the command in Iberia after the death of
Hamilcar, they waited at first to ascertain <span class="sidenote">Death of Hamilcar,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;229.</span>
the feelings of the army; but when news came from
thence that the troops had elected Hannibal as
commander-in-chief, a popular assembly was at once held, and
the choice of the army confirmed by a unanimous vote. As
soon as he had taken over the command, Hannibal <span class="sidenote">Death of Hasdrubal,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;221.</span>
set out to subdue the tribe of the Olcades;
and, having arrived before their most formidable
city Althaea, he pitched his camp under its walls;
and by a series of energetic and formidable assaults succeeded
before long in taking it: by which the rest of the tribe were
overawed into submission to Carthage. Having imposed
a contribution upon the towns, and thus become possessed of a
large sum of money, he went to the New Town to winter.
There, by a liberal treatment of the forces under his command,
giving them an instalment of their pay at once and promising
the rest, he established an excellent feeling towards himself in
the army, as well as great hopes for the future.</p>

<p><a name="b3_14" id="b3_14"><b>14.</b></a> Next summer he set out on another expedition against
the Vaccaei, in which he took Salmantica by <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.
Hannibal attacks

assault, but only succeeded in storming Arbucala,
owing to the size of the town and the number
and valour of its inhabitants, after a laborious siege. After this
he suddenly found himself in a position of very great danger
on his return march: being set upon by the Carpesii, the
strongest tribe in those parts, who were joined also by neighbouring
tribes, incited principally by refugees of the Olcades,
but roused also to great wrath by those who escaped from
Salmantica. If the Carthaginians had been compelled to give
these people regular battle, there can be no doubt that they
would have been defeated: but as it was, Hannibal, with
admirable skill and caution, slowly retreated until he had put the
Tagus between himself and the enemy; and thus giving battle
at the crossing of the stream, supported by it and the elephants,
of which he had about forty, he gained, to every one&#8217;s surprise,
a complete success. For when the barbarians attempted to
force a crossing at several points of the river at once, the
greater number of them were killed as they left the water by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the elephants, who marched up and down along the brink of
the river and caught them as they were coming out. Many of
them also were killed in the river itself by the cavalry, because
the horses were better able than the men to stand against the
stream, and also because the cavalry were fighting on higher
ground than the infantry which they were attacking. At
length Hannibal turned the tables on the enemy, and, recrossing
the river, attacked and put to flight their whole army, to
the number of more than a hundred thousand men. After
the defeat of this host, no one south of the Iber rashly ventured
to face him except the people of Saguntum. From that town
Hannibal tried his best to keep aloof; because, acting on the
suggestions and advice of his father Hamilcar, he did not wish
to give the Romans an avowed pretext for war until he had
thoroughly secured the rest of the country.</p>

<p><a name="b3_15" id="b3_15"><b>15.</b></a> But the people of Saguntum kept sending ambassadors
to Rome, partly because they foresaw what was
coming, <span class="sidenote">Saguntum appeals
to Rome.
Winter of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
220-219.</span>and trembled for their own existence,
and partly that the Romans might be kept fully
aware of the growing power of the Carthaginians
in Iberia. For a long time the Romans disregarded
their words: but now they sent out some commissioners to see
what was going on. Just at that time Hannibal had finished
the conquests which he intended for that season, and was
going into winter quarters at the New Town again, which was in
a way the chief glory and capital town of the Carthaginians in
Iberia. He found there the embassy from Rome, granted them
an interview, and listened to the message with which they were
charged. It was a strong injunction to him to leave Saguntum
alone, as being under the protection of Rome; and not to cross
the Iber, in accordance with the agreement come to in the
time of Hasdrubal. To this Hannibal answered with all the
heat of youth, inflamed by martial ardour, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal&#8217;s
defiance.</span>
recent success, and his long-standing hatred of
Rome. He charged the Romans with having a short time before,
when on some political disturbances arising in the town they
had been chosen to act as arbitrators, seized the opportunity to
put some of the leading citizens to death; and he declared
that the Carthaginians would not allow the Saguntines to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
thus treacherously dealt with, for it was the traditional policy
of Carthage to protect all persons so wronged. At the same
time he sent home for instructions as to what he was to do
&#8220;in view of the fact that the Saguntines were injuring certain
of their subject allies.&#8221; And altogether he was in a state of
unreasoning anger and violent exasperation, which prevented
him from availing himself of the real causes for war, and made
him take refuge in pretexts which would not admit of justification,
after the manner of men whose passions master all
considerations of equity. How much better it would have
been to demand of Rome the restoration of Sardinia, and the
remission of the tribute, which she had taken an unfair
opportunity to impose on pain of a declaration of war. As
it was, he said not a word of the real cause, but alleged the
fictitious one of the matter of Saguntum; and so got the credit
of beginning the war, not only in defiance of reason, but still
more in defiance of justice. The Roman ambassadors, finding
that there must undoubtedly be a war, sailed to Carthage to
enter the same protest before the people there. They expected,
however, that they would have to fight not in Italy,
but in Iberia, and that they would have Saguntum as a base of
operations.</p>

<p><a name="b3_16" id="b3_16"><b>16.</b></a> Wherefore the Senate, by way of preparing to undertake
this business, and foreseeing that the war <span class="sidenote">Illyrian war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219.</span>
would be severe and protracted, and at a long
distance from the mother country, determined
to make Illyria safe. For it happened that, just at this time,
Demetrius of Pharos was sacking and subduing to his authority
the cities of Illyria which were subject to Rome, and had
sailed beyond Lissus, in violation of the treaty, with fifty
galleys, and had ravaged many of the Cyclades. For he
had quite forgotten the former kindnesses done him by
Rome, and had conceived a contempt for its power, when
he saw it threatened first by the Gauls and then by Carthage;
and he now rested all his hopes on the royal family of
Macedonia, because he had fought on the side of Antigonus,
and shared with him the dangers of the war against
Cleomenes. These transactions attracted the observation of
the Romans; who, seeing that the royal house of Macedonia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
was in a flourishing condition, were very anxious to secure the
country east of Italy, feeling convinced that they would have
ample time to correct the rash folly of the Illyrians, and rebuke
and chastise the ingratitude and temerity of Demetrius. But
they were deceived in their calculations. For Hannibal anticipated
their measures by the capture of Saguntum: the result
of which was that the war took place not in Iberia, but close <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219.

to Rome itself, and in various parts throughout
all Italy. However, with these ideas fixed in
their minds, the Romans despatched Lucius
Aemilius just before summer to conduct the
Illyrian campaign in the first year of the 140th Olympiad.</p>

<p><a name="b3_17" id="b3_17"><b>17.</b></a> But Hannibal had started from New Carthage and was
leading his army straight against Saguntum. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal besieges
Saguntum.</span>
This city is situated on the seaward foot of
the mountain chain on which the frontiers of Iberia and
Celtiberia converge, and is about seven stades from the sea.
The district cultivated by its inhabitants is exceedingly
productive, and has a soil superior to any in all Iberia.
Under the walls of this town Hannibal pitched his camp
and set energetically to work on the siege, foreseeing many
advantages that would accrue if he could take it. Of these
the first was that he would thereby disappoint the Romans
in their expectation of making Iberia the seat of war: a
second was that he would thereby strike a general terror,
which would render the already obedient tribes more submissive,
and the still independent ones more cautious of
offending him: but the greatest advantage of all was that
thereby he would be able to push on his advance, without
leaving an enemy on his rear. Besides these advantages, he
calculated that the possession of this city would secure him
abundant supplies for his expedition, and create an enthusiasm
in the troops excited by individual acquisitions of booty;
while he would conciliate the goodwill of those who remained
at Carthage by the spoils which would be sent home. With
these ideas he pressed on the siege with energy: sometimes
setting an example to his soldiers by personally sharing in the
fatigues of throwing up the siege works; and sometimes cheering
on his men and recklessly exposing himself to danger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>After a siege extending to the eighth month, in the course of
which he endured every kind of suffering and <span class="sidenote">Fall of Saguntum.</span>
anxiety, he finally succeeded in taking the town.
An immense booty in money, slaves, and property fell into
his hands, which he disposed of in accordance with his original
design. The money he reserved for the needs of his projected
expedition; the slaves were distributed according to
merit among his men; while the property was at once sent
entire to Carthage. The result answered his expectations: the
army was rendered more eager for action; the home populace
more ready to grant whatever he asked; and he himself was
enabled, by the possession of such abundant means, to carry
out many measures that were of service to his expedition.</p>

<p><a name="b3_18" id="b3_18"><b>18.</b></a> While this was taking place, Demetrius, discovering
the intentions of Rome, threw a sufficient garrison
into Dimale and victualled it in proportion. <span class="sidenote">Illyrian war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219.</span>
In the other towns he put those who were opposed to him
to death, and placed the chief power in the hands of his own
partisans; and selecting six thousand of the bravest of his
subjects, quartered them in Pharos. When the Consul
arrived in Illyria with his army, he found the enemies of
Rome confident in the strength of Dimale and the elaborate
preparations in it, and encouraged to resistance by their belief in
its impregnability; he determined, therefore, to attack that town
first, in order to strike terror into the enemy. Accordingly,
after addressing an exhortation to the several officers of the
legions, and throwing up siege works at several points, he began
the siege in form. In seven days he took the town by assault,
which so dismayed the enemy, that envoys immediately
appeared from all the towns, surrendering themselves unconditionally
to the protection of Rome. The Consul accepted
their submission: and after imposing such conditions
as appeared suitable to the several cases, he sailed to Pharos
to attack Demetrius himself. Being informed that the city
there was strongly fortified, thronged with excellent soldiers,
and well-furnished with provisions and all other munitions of
war, he began to entertain misgivings that the siege would be
long and difficult; and therefore, with a view to these difficulties,
he adopted on the spur of the moment the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
stratagem. He crossed to the island by night with his whole
army. The greater part of it he disembarked at a spot where
the ground was well-wooded and low; while with only twenty
ships he sailed at daybreak to the harbour nearest the town.
The smallness of the number of the ships moved only the
contempt of Demetrius when he saw them, and he immediately
marched out of the town down to the harbour to oppose the
landing of the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b3_19" id="b3_19"><b>19.</b></a> A violent struggle at once began: and, as it went on,
division after division of the troops in the city <span class="sidenote">Capture of Pharos.</span>
came down to support him, until at length the
whole force had poured out to take part in the engagement. The
Romans who had landed in the night arrived at the critical
moment, after a march by an obscure route; and seizing
a strong position on some rising ground between the city and
the harbour, efficiently cut off from the city the troops that had
sallied out. When Demetrius became aware of what had
taken place, he desisted from opposing the disembarkation;
and having rallied his men and addressed the ranks, he put
them in motion, with the resolution of fighting a pitched
battle with the troops on the hill. When the Romans
saw the Illyrian advance being made in good order and with
great spirit, they formed their ranks and charged furiously.
At the same moment the Roman troops which had just
effected their landing, seeing what was going on, charged
the enemy on the rear, who being thus attacked on both
sides, were thrown into great disorder and confusion. The
result was that, finding both his van and his rear in difficulties,
Demetrius fled. Some of his men retreated towards the city;
but most of them escaped by bye-paths into various parts of the
island. Demetrius himself made his way to some galleys which
he kept at anchor at a solitary point on the coast, with a view
to every contingency; and going on board, he sailed away
at nightfall, and arrived unexpectedly at the court of King
Philip, where he passed the remainder of his life:&mdash;a man
whose undoubted boldness and courage were unsupported by
either prudence or judgment. His end was of a piece with the
whole tenor of his life; for while endeavouring at the instigation
of Philip to seize Messene, he exposed himself during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the battle with a careless rashness which cost him his life; of
which I shall speak in detail when I come to that period.</p>

<p>The Consul Aemilius having thus taken Pharos at a blow,
levelled the city to the ground; and then having become
master of all Illyria, and having ordered all its affairs as he
thought right, returned towards the end of the summer to
Rome, where he celebrated a triumph amid expressions of
unmixed approval; for people considered that he had managed
this business with great prudence and even greater courage.</p>

<p><a name="b3_20" id="b3_20"><b>20.</b></a> But when news came to Rome of the fall of Saguntum,
there was indeed no debate on the question of
war, <span class="sidenote">Indignation at
Rome at the fall
of Saguntum.</span>as some historians assert; who even add
the speeches delivered on either side. But
nothing could be more ridiculous. For is it conceivable
that the Romans should have a year before proclaimed
war with the Carthaginians in the event of their entering
the territory of Saguntum, and yet, when the city itself
had been taken, should have debated whether they should
go to war or no? Just as absurd are the wonderful statements
that the senators put on mourning, and that the
fathers introduced their sons above twelve years old into the
Senate House, who, being admitted to the debate, refrained
from divulging any of its secrets even to their nearest relations.
All this is as improbable as it is untrue; unless we are to
believe that Fortune, among its other bounties, granted the
Romans the privilege of being men of the world from their
cradles. I need not waste any more words upon such compositions
as those of Chaereas and Sosilus;<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> which, in my
judgment, are more like the gossip of the barber&#8217;s shop and the
pavement than history.</p>

<p>The truth is that, when the Romans heard of the disaster
at Saguntum, they at once elected envoys, whom <span class="sidenote">Envoys sent to
Carthage to
demand surrender
of Hannibal.</span>
they despatched in all haste to Carthage with
the offer of two alternatives, one of which appeared
to the Carthaginians to involve disgrace
as well as injury if they accepted it, while the other was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>beginning of a great struggle and of great dangers. For one
of these alternatives was the surrender of Hannibal and
his staff to Rome, the other was war. When the Roman
envoys arrived and declared their message to the Senate, the
choice proposed to them between these alternatives was
listened to by the Carthaginians with indignation. Still they
selected the most capable of their number to state their case,
which was grounded on the following pleas.</p>

<p><a name="b3_21" id="b3_21"><b>21.</b></a> Passing over the treaty made with Hasdrubal, as not
having ever been made, and, if it had, as not being binding on
them because made without their consent (and on this point
they quoted the precedent of the Romans themselves, who
in the Sicilian war repudiated the terms agreed upon and
accepted by Lutatius, as having been made without their
consent)&mdash;passing over this, they pressed with all the
vehemence they could, throughout the discussion, the last
treaty made in the Sicilian war; in which they affirmed that
there was no clause relating to Iberia, but one expressly providing
security for the allies of both parties to the treaty. Now,
they pointed out that the Saguntines at that time were not allies
of Rome, and therefore were not protected by the clause. To
prove their point, they read the treaty more than once aloud.
On this occasion the Roman envoys contented themselves
with the reply that, while Saguntum was intact, the matter in
dispute admitted of pleadings and of a discussion on its merits;
but that, that city having been treacherously seized, they had
only two alternatives,&mdash;either to deliver the persons guilty of
the act, and thereby make it clear that they had no share in
their crime, and that it was done without their consent; or, if
they were not willing to do that, and avowed their complicity
in it, to take the consequences.</p>

<p>The question of treaties between Rome and Carthage was
referred to in general terms in the course of this debate: but I
think a more particular examination of it will be useful both to
practical statesmen, who require to know the exact truth of the
matter, in order to avoid mistakes in any critical deliberation;
and to historical students, that they may not be led astray by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>the ignorance or partisan bias of historians; but may have
before them a conspectus, acknowledged to be accurate, of the
various compacts which have been made between Rome and
Carthage from the earliest times to our own day.</p>

<p><a name="b3_22" id="b3_22"><b>22.</b></a> The first treaty between Rome and Carthage was made
in the year of Lucius Junius Brutus and Marcus
Horatius, <span class="sidenote">Treaties between
Rome and
Carthage.</span>the first Consuls appointed after the
expulsion of the kings, by which men also
the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated. This was
twenty-eight years before the invasion of Greece
by Xerxes. Of this treaty I append a translation, <span class="sidenote">The first treaty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;509-508.</span>
as accurate as I could make it,&mdash;for the
fact is that the ancient language differs so much from that at
present in use, that the best scholars among the Romans themselves
have great difficulty in interpreting some points in it,
even after much study. The treaty is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There shall be friendship between the Romans and their
allies, and the Carthaginians and their allies, on these conditions:</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither the Romans nor their allies are to sail beyond
the Fair Promontory, unless driven by stress of weather or the
fear of enemies. If any one of them be driven ashore he
shall not buy or take aught for himself save what is needful
for the repair of his ship and the service of the gods, and he
shall depart within five days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men landing for traffic shall strike no bargain save in the
presence of a herald or town-clerk. Whatever is sold in the
presence of these, let the price be secured to the seller on the
credit of the state&mdash;that is to say, if such sale be in Libya or
Sardinia.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any Roman comes to the Carthaginian province in
Sicily he shall enjoy all rights enjoyed by others. The Carthaginians
shall do no injury to the people of Ardea, Antium,
Laurentium, Circeii, Tarracina, nor any other people of the
Latins that are subject to Rome.</p>

<p>&#8220;From those townships even which are not subject to
Rome<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> they shall hold their hands; and if they take one shall
deliver it unharmed to the Romans. They shall build no fort
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>in Latium; and if they enter the district in arms, they shall not
stay a night therein.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b3_23" id="b3_23"><b>23.</b></a> The &#8220;Fair Promontory&#8221; here referred to is that which
lies immediately to the north of Carthage; south of which the
Carthaginians stipulated that the Romans should not sail with
ships of war, because, as I imagine, they did not wish them to
be acquainted with the coast near Byzacium, or the lesser
Syrtis, which places they call Emporia, owing to the productiveness
of the district. The treaty then goes on to say
that, if any one of them is driven thither by stress of weather
or fear of an enemy, and stands in need of anything for the
worship of the gods and the repair of his vessel, this and no
more he may take; and all those who have come to anchor
there must necessarily depart within five days. To Carthage,
and all the country on the Carthaginian side of the Fair Promontory
in Libya, to Sardinia, and the Carthaginian province of
Sicily, the treaty allows the Romans to sail for mercantile
purposes; and the Carthaginians engage their public credit
that such persons shall enjoy absolute security.</p>

<p>It is clear from this treaty that the Carthaginians speak of
Sardinia and Libya as belonging to them entirely; but, on the
other hand, make a distinction in the case of Sicily, and only
stipulate for that part of it which is subject to Carthage.
Similarly, the Romans also only stipulate concerning Latium;
the rest of Italy they do not mention, as not being under their
authority.</p>

<p><a name="b3_24" id="b3_24"><b>24.</b></a> After this treaty there was a second, in which we find
that the Carthaginians have included the <span class="sidenote">Second treaty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;306 (?).</span>
Tyrians and the township of Utica in addition
to their former territory; and to the Fair
Promontory Mastia and Tarseium are added, as the points
east of which the Romans are not to make marauding expeditions
or found a city. The treaty is as follows: &#8220;There
shall be friendship between the Romans and their allies,
and the Carthaginians, Tyrians, and township of Utica, on
these terms: The Romans shall not maraud, nor traffic,
nor found a city east of the Fair Promontory, Mastia,
Tarseium. If the Carthaginians take any city in Latium which
is not subject to Rome, they may keep the prisoners and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
goods, but shall deliver up the town. If the Carthaginians
take any folk, between whom and Rome a peace has been
made in writing, though they be not subject to them, they
shall not bring them into any harbours of the Romans; if such
an one be so brought ashore, and any Roman lay claim to
him,<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> he shall be released. In like manner shall the Romans
be bound towards the Carthaginians.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a Roman take water or provisions from any district
within the jurisdiction of Carthage, he shall not injure, while
so doing, any between whom and Carthage there is peace
and friendship. Neither shall a Carthaginian in like case. If
any one shall do so, he shall not be punished by private
vengeance, but such action shall be a public misdemeanour.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Sardinia and Libya no Roman shall traffic nor found
a city; he shall do no more than take in provisions and refit
his ship. If a storm drive him upon those coasts, he shall
depart within five days.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Carthaginian province of Sicily and in Carthage
he may transact business and sell whatsoever it is lawful
for a citizen to do. In like manner also may a Carthaginian
at Rome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more in this treaty we may notice that the Carthaginians
emphasise the fact of their entire possession of Libya and
Sardinia, and prohibit any attempt of the Romans to land in
them at all; and on the other hand, in the case of Sicily, they
clearly distinguish their own province in it. So, too, the
Romans, in regard to Latium, stipulate that the Carthaginians
shall do no wrong to Ardea, Antium, Circeii, Tarracina, all of
which are on the seaboard of Latium, to which alone the
treaty refers.</p>

<p><a name="b3_25" id="b3_25"><b>25.</b></a> A third treaty again was made by Rome at the time of
the invasion of Pyrrhus into Sicily, before the <span class="sidenote">Third treaty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;279.</span>
Carthaginians undertook the war for the possession
of Sicily. This treaty contains the same
provisions as the two earlier treaties with these additional
clauses:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they make a treaty of alliance with Pyrrhus, the
Romans or Carthaginians shall make it on such terms as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>not to preclude the one giving aid to the other, if that one&#8217;s
territory is attacked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If one or the other stand in need of help, the Carthaginians
shall supply the ships, whether for transport or war;
but each people shall supply the pay for its own men employed
on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Carthaginians shall also give aid by sea to the
Romans if need be; but no one shall compel the crews to
disembark against their will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Provision was also made for swearing to these treaties. In
the case of the first, the Carthaginians were to swear by the
gods of their ancestors, the Romans by Jupiter Lapis, in
accordance with an ancient custom; in the case of the last
treaty, by Mars and Quirinus.</p>

<p>The form of swearing by Jupiter Lapis was this. The
commissioner for swearing to the treaty took a stone in his
hand, and, having taken the oath in the name of his country,
added these words, &#8220;If I abide by this oath may he bless me;
but if I do otherwise in thought or act, may all others be kept
safe each in his own country, under his own laws, in enjoyment
of his own goods, household gods, and tombs,&mdash;may I alone
be cast out, even as this stone is now.&#8221; And having uttered
these words he throws the stone from his hand.</p>

<p><a name="b3_26" id="b3_26"><b>26.</b></a> Seeing that such treaties exist and are preserved to
this day, engraved on brass in the treasury of <span class="sidenote">Misstatement of
Philinus.</span>
the Aediles in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,
the historian Philinus certainly does give us some reason
to be surprised at him. Not at his ignorance of their
existence: for even in our own day those Romans and
Carthaginians, whose age placed them nearest to the times,
and who had the reputation of taking the greatest interest
in public affairs, were unaware of it. But what is surprising
is, that he should have ventured on a statement exactly opposite:
&#8220;That there was a treaty between Rome and Carthage, in
virtue of which the Romans were bound to keep away from the
whole of Sicily, the Carthaginians from the whole of Italy; and
that the Romans broke the treaty and their oath when they
first crossed over to Sicily.&#8221; Whereas there does not exist,
nor ever has existed, any such written compact at all. Yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
this assertion he makes in so many words in his second book.
I referred to this in the preface of my work, but reserved a
more detailed discussion of it to this place; which was
necessary, because the assertion of Philinus has misled a
considerable number of people on this point. I have nothing
to say if a man chooses to attack the Romans for crossing into
Sicily, on the grounds of their having taken the Mamertines
into alliance at all; or in having thus acted in answer to their
request, after these men&#8217;s treachery to Rhegium as well as
Messene: but if any one supposes that in so crossing they
broke oaths or treaties, he is manifestly ignorant of the truth.</p>

<p><a name="b3_27" id="b3_27"><b>27.</b></a> At the end of the first Punic war another treaty was
made, of which the chief provisions were these: <span class="sidenote">Fourth treaty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;241.</span>
&#8220;The Carthaginians shall evacuate Sicily and
all islands lying between Italy and Sicily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The allies of neither of the parties to the treaty shall be
attacked by the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither party shall impose any contribution, nor erect any
public building, nor enlist soldiers in the dominions of the
other, nor make any compact of friendship with the allies of
the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Carthaginians shall within ten years pay to the
Romans two-thousand two-hundred talents, and a thousand
on the spot; and shall restore all prisoners, without ransom,
to the Romans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Afterwards, at the end of the Mercenary war in Africa, the
Romans went so far as to pass a decree for war <span class="sidenote">Fifth treaty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;238.</span>
with Carthage, but eventually made a treaty to
the following effect: &#8220;The Carthaginians shall
evacuate Sardinia, and pay an additional twelve hundred
talents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, in addition to these treaties, came that negotiated
with Hasdrubal in Iberia, in which it was <span class="sidenote">Sixth treaty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;228.</span>
stipulated that &#8220;the Carthaginians should not
cross the Iber with arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such were the mutual obligations established between
Rome and Carthage from the earliest times to that of
Hannibal.</p>

<p><a name="b3_28" id="b3_28"><b>28.</b></a> As we find then that the Roman invasion of Sicily was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
not in contravention of their oaths, so we must acknowledge
in the case of the second proclamation of
war, <span class="sidenote">No excuse for the
Roman claim
on Sardinia.</span>in consequence of which the treaty for
the evacuation of Sardinia was made, that
it is impossible to find any reasonable pretext or ground
for the Roman action. The Carthaginians were beyond
question compelled by the necessities of their position, contrary
to all justice, to evacuate Sardinia, and to pay this enormous sum
of money. For as to the allegation of the Romans, that they
had during the Mercenary war been guilty of acts of hostility
to ships sailing from Rome,&mdash;that was barred by their own act
in restoring, without ransom, the Carthaginian prisoners, in
gratitude for similar conduct on the part of Carthage to
Romans who had landed on their shores; a transaction which
I have spoken of at length in my previous book.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>These facts established, it remains to decide by a thorough
investigation to which of the two nations the origin of the
Hannibalian war is to be imputed.</p>

<p><a name="b3_29" id="b3_29"><b>29.</b></a> I have explained the pleas advanced by the Carthaginians;
I must now state what is alleged on the contrary by
the Romans. For though it is true that in this particular interview,
owing to their anger at the fall of Saguntum, they did
not use these arguments, yet they were appealed to on many
occasions, and by many of their citizens. <span class="sidenote">The Roman
Case.</span>First,
they argued that the treaty of Hasdrubal could
not be ignored, as the Carthaginians had the assurance to do:
for it did not contain the clause, which that of Lutatius did,
making its validity conditional on its ratification by the people
of Rome; but Hasdrubal made the agreement absolutely and
authoritatively that &#8220;the Carthaginians should not cross the
Iber in arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next they alleged that the clause in the treaty respecting
Sicily, which by their own admission stipulated that &#8220;the allies
of neither party should be attacked by the other,&#8221; did not refer
to then existing allies only, as the Carthaginians interpreted it;
for in that case a clause would have been added, disabling either
from making new alliances in addition to those already existing,
or excluding allies, taken subsequently to the making of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>treaty, from its benefits. But since neither of these provisions
was made, it was plain that both the then existing allies, and
all those taken subsequently on either side, were entitled to
reciprocal security. And this was only reasonable. For it
was not likely that they would have made a treaty depriving
them of the power, when opportunity offered, of taking
on such friends or allies as seemed to their interest; nor,
again, if they had taken any such under their protection,
was it to be supposed that they would allow them to be
injured by any persons whatever. But, in fact, the main thing
present in the minds of both parties to the treaty was, that
they should mutually agree to abstain from attacking each
other&#8217;s allies, and on no account admit into alliance with
themselves the allies of the other: and it was to subsequent
allies that this particular clause applied, &#8220;Neither shall enlist
soldiers, or impose contributions on the provinces or allies of
the other; and all shall be alike secure of attack from the
other side.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b3_30" id="b3_30"><b>30.</b></a> These things being so, they argued that it was beyond
controversy that Saguntum had accepted the protection of
Rome, several years before the time of Hannibal. The
strongest proof of this, and one which would not be contested
by the Carthaginians themselves, was that, when political
disturbances broke out at Saguntum, the people chose the
Romans, and not the Carthaginians, as arbitrators to settle the
dispute and restore their constitution, although the latter were
close at hand and were already established in Iberia.</p>

<p>I conclude, then, that if the destruction of Saguntum is to
be regarded as the cause of this war, the Carthaginians
must be acknowledged to be in <span class="sidenote">Mutual
provocation.</span>
the wrong, both in view of the treaty of Lutatius, which
secured immunity from attack for the allies of both parties,
and in view of the treaty of Hasdrubal, which disabled
the Carthaginians from passing the Iber with arms.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> If
on the other hand the taking Sardinia from them, and imposing
the heavy money fine which accompanied it, are to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>be regarded as the causes, we must certainly acknowledge
that the Carthaginians had good reason for undertaking
the Hannibalian war: for as they had only yielded to the
pressure of circumstances, so they seized a favourable turn in
those circumstances to revenge themselves on their injurers.</p>

<p><a name="b3_31" id="b3_31"><b>31.</b></a> Some uncritical readers may perhaps say that such
minute discussion on points of this kind is unnecessary. And
if any man were entirely self-sufficing in every event, I might
allow that the accurate knowledge of the past, though a graceful
accomplishment, was perhaps not essential: but as long as
it is not in mere mortals to say this, either in public or private
affairs,&mdash;seeing that no man of sense, even if he is prosperous
for the moment, will ever reckon with certainty on the future,&mdash;then
I say that such knowledge is essential, and not merely
graceful. For take the three commonest cases. Suppose,
first, a statesman to be attacked either in his own person or in
that of his country: or, secondly, suppose him to be anxious
for a forward policy and to anticipate the attack of an enemy:
or, lastly, suppose him to desire to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.
In all these cases it is history alone that can supply him with
precedents, and teach him how, in the first case, to find supporters
and allies; in the second, to incite co-operation; and
in the third, to give vigour to the conservative forces which
tend to maintain, as he desires, the existing state of things.
In the case of contemporaries, it is difficult to obtain an insight
into their purposes; because, as their words and actions are
dictated by a desire of accommodating themselves to the
necessity of the hour, and of keeping up appearances, the truth
is too often obscured. Whereas the transactions of the past
admit of being tested by naked fact; and accordingly display
without disguise the motives and purposes of the several persons
engaged; and teach us from what sort of people to expect
favour, active kindness, and assistance, or the reverse. They
give us also many opportunities of distinguishing who would
be likely to pity us, feel indignation at our wrongs, and defend
our cause,&mdash;a power that contributes very greatly to national
as well as individual security. Neither the writer nor the
reader of history, therefore, should confine his attention to a
bare statement of facts: he must take into account all that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
preceded, accompanied, or followed them. For if you take
from history all explanation of cause, principle, and motive,
and of the adaptation of the means to the end, what is left
is a mere panorama without being instructive; and, though
it may please for the moment, has no abiding value.</p>

<p><a name="b3_32" id="b3_32"><b>32.</b></a> Another mistake is to look upon my history as difficult
to obtain or master, because of the number and size of the
books. Compare it in these particulars with the various
writings of the episodical historians. Is it not much easier to
purchase and read my forty books, which are as it were all in
one piece, and so to follow with a comprehensive glance the
events in Italy, Sicily, and Libya from the time of Pyrrhus to
the fall of Carthage, and those in the rest of the world from
the flight of Cleomenes of Sparta, continuously, to the battle
between the Achaeans and Romans at the Isthmus? To say
nothing of the fact that the compositions of these historians
are many times as numerous as mine, it is impossible for their
readers to get any certain information from them: first,
because most of them differ in their account of the same
transactions; and secondly, because they omit contemporary
history,&mdash;the comparative review of which would put a very
different complexion upon events to that derived from isolated
treatment,&mdash;and are unable to touch upon the most decisive
events at all. For, indeed, the most important parts of history
are those which treat the events which follow or accompany
a certain course of conduct, and pre-eminently so those
which treat of causes. For instance, we see that the war with
Antiochus took its rise from that with Philip; that with Philip
from the Hannibalian; and the Hannibalian from the Sicilian
war: and though between these wars there were numerous
events of various character, they all converged upon the same
consummation. Such a comprehensive view may be obtained
from universal history, but not from the histories of particular
wars, such as those with Perseus or Philip; unless we fondly
imagine that, by reading the accounts contained in them of
the pitched battles, we gain a knowledge of the conduct
and plan of the whole war. This of course is not the
case; and in the present instance I hope that there will be
as wide a difference between my history and such episodical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
compositions, as between real learning and mere listening.</p>

<p><a name="b3_33" id="b3_33"><b>33.</b></a> To resume the story of the Carthaginians and the Roman
deputies.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> To the arguments of the former the <span class="sidenote">Answer of Fabius.
See Livy, 21, 18.</span>
ambassadors made no answer, except that the
senior among them, in the presence of the assembly, pointed
to the folds of his toga and said that in them he carried
peace and war, and that he would bring out and leave with
them whichever they bade him. The Carthaginian Suffete<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
bade him bring out whichever of the two he chose: and upon
the Roman saying that it should be war, a majority of the senators
cried out in answer that they accepted it. It was on these terms
that the Senate and the Roman ambassadors parted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hannibal, upon going into winter quarters at
New Carthage, first of all dismissed the Iberians
to their various cities, with the view of their being
prepared and vigorous for the next campaign. <span class="sidenote">Winter of 219-218
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;Hannibal&#8217;s
arrangements
for the
coming campaign.</span>
Secondly, he instructed his brother Hasdrubal
in the management of his government in Iberia,
and of the preparations to be made against
Rome, in case he himself should be separated from him.
Thirdly, he took precautions for the security of Libya, by
selecting with prudent skill certain soldiers from the home
army to come over to Iberia, and certain from the Iberian
army to go to Libya; by which interchange he secured cordial
feeling of confidence between the two armies. The Iberians
sent to Libya were the Thersitae, the Mastiani, as well as
the Oretes and Olcades, mustering together twelve hundred
cavalry and thirteen thousand eight hundred and fifty foot.
Besides these there were eight hundred and seventy slingers
from the Balearic Isles, whose name, as that of the islands
they inhabit, is derived from the word <i>ballein</i>, &#8220;to throw,&#8221;
because of their peculiar skill with the sling. Most of these
troops he ordered to be stationed at Metagonia in Libya, and
the rest in Carthage itself. And from the cities in the district
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>of Metagonia he sent four thousand foot also into Carthage, to
serve at once as hostages for the fidelity of their country, and as
an additional guard for the city. With his brother Hasdrubal
in Iberia he left fifty quinqueremes, two quadriremes, and five
triremes, thirty-two of the quinqueremes being furnished with
crews, and all five of the triremes; also cavalry consisting of
four hundred and fifty Libyophenicians and Libyans, three
hundred Lergetae, eighteen hundred Numidians of the Massolian,
Massaesylian, Maccoeian, and Maurian tribes, who dwell
by the ocean; with eleven thousand eight hundred and fifty
Libyans, three hundred Ligures, five hundred of the Balearic
Islanders, and twenty-one elephants.</p>

<p>The accuracy of this enumeration of Hannibal&#8217;s Iberian
establishment need excite no surprise, though <span class="sidenote">The inscription
recording these
facts.</span>
it is such as a commander himself would have
some difficulty in displaying; nor ought I to
be condemned at once of imitating the specious falsehoods
of historians: for the fact is that I myself found on Lacinium<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>
a bronze tablet, which Hannibal had caused to be inscribed
with these particulars when he was in Italy; and holding it
to be an entirely trustworthy authority for such facts, I did
not hesitate to follow it.</p>

<p><a name="b3_34" id="b3_34"><b>34.</b></a> Though Hannibal had taken every precaution for the
security of Libya and Iberia, he yet waited for the messengers
whom he expected to arrive from the Celts. He had thoroughly
acquainted himself with the fertility and populousness of the
districts at the foot of the Alps and in the valley of the
Padus, as well as with the warlike courage of the men;
but most important of all, with their hostile feelings to Rome
derived from the previous war, which I described in my last
book, with the express purpose of enabling my readers to
follow my narrative. He therefore reckoned very much on
the chance of their co-operation; and was careful to send
messages to the chiefs of the Celts, whether dwelling actually
on the Alps or on the Italian side of them, with unlimited
promises; because he believed that he would be able to confine
the war against Rome to Italy, if he could make his way
through the intervening difficulties to these parts, and avail
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>himself of the active alliance of the Celts. When his messengers
returned with a report that the Celts were ready to help
him and all eagerness for his approach; and that the passage
of the Alps, though laborious and difficult, was not, however,
impossible, he collected his forces from their winter quarters
at the approach of spring. Just before receiving this report
he had learnt the circumstances attending the Roman embassy
at Carthage. Encouraged by the assurance thus given him,
that he would be supported by the popular sentiment at home,
he no longer disguised from his army that the object of the
forthcoming campaign was Rome; and tried to inspire them
with courage for the undertaking. He explained to them how
the Romans had demanded the surrender of himself and all
the officers of the army: and pointed out the fertility of the
country to which they were going, and the goodwill and
active alliance which the Celts were prepared to offer them.
When the crowd of soldiers showed an enthusiastic readiness
to accompany him, he dismissed the assembly, after
thanking them, and naming the day on which he intended
to march.</p>

<p><a name="b3_35" id="b3_35"><b>35.</b></a> These measures satisfactorily accomplished while he was
in winter quarters, and the security of Libya <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218.
Hannibal breaks
up his winter
quarters and
starts for Italy.</span>
and Iberia being sufficiently provided for; when
the appointed day arrived, Hannibal got his army
in motion, which consisted of ninety thousand
infantry and about twelve thousand cavalry.
After crossing the Iber, he set about subduing the tribes of
the Ilurgetes and Bargusii, as well as the Aerenosii and Andosini,
as far as the Pyrenees. When he had reduced all this
country under his power, and taken certain towns by storm,
which he did with unexpected rapidity, though not without
severe fighting and serious loss; he left Hanno in chief command
of all the district north of the Iber, and with absolute
authority over the Burgusii, who were the people that gave
him most uneasiness on account of their friendly feeling towards
Rome. He then detached from his army ten thousand
foot and a thousand horse for the service of Hanno,&mdash;to whom
also he entrusted the heavy baggage of the troops that were to
accompany himself,&mdash;and the same number to go to their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
land. The object of this last measure was twofold: he thereby
left a certain number of well-affected persons behind him; and
also held out to the others a hope of returning home, both to
those Iberians who were to accompany him on his march, and
to those also who for the present were to remain at home, so
that there might be a general alacrity to join him if he were
ever in want of a reinforcement. He then set his remaining
troops in motion unencumbered by heavy baggage, fifty thousand
infantry and nine thousand cavalry, and led them through
the Pyrenees to the passage of the river Rhone. The army
was not so much numerous, as highly efficient, and in an extraordinary
state of physical training from their continuous
battles with the Iberians.</p>

<p><a name="b3_36" id="b3_36"><b>36.</b></a> But as a knowledge of topography is necessary for the
right understanding of my narrative, <span class="sidenote">Geography of
Hannibal&#8217;s march.</span>I must state
the places from which Hannibal started, through
which he marched, and into which he descended when he
arrived in Italy. Nor must I, like some historians, content
myself with mentioning the mere names of places and rivers,
under the idea that that is quite sufficient to give a clear knowledge.
My opinion is that, in the case of well-known places,
the mention of names is of great assistance, but that, in the
case of unknown countries, names are no better than unintelligible
and unmeaning sounds: for the understanding
having nothing to go upon, and being unable by referring to
something known to translate the words into thought, the narrative
becomes confused and vague, and conveys no clear idea.
A plan therefore must be discovered, whereby it shall be
possible, while speaking of unknown countries, to convey real
and intelligible notions.</p>

<p>The first, most important, and most general conception is
that of the division of the heaven into four quarters, which all
of us that are capable of a general idea at all know as east,
west, south, and north. The next is to arrange the several
parts of the globe according to these points, and always
to refer in thought any place mentioned to one or other
of them. We shall thus get an intelligible and familiar
conception of places which we do not know or have never
seen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b3_37" id="b3_37"><b>37.</b></a> This principle established as universally applicable to
the world, the next point will be to make the <span class="sidenote">General view of
the geography of
the world.</span>
geography of our own part of it intelligible by a
corresponding division.</p>

<p>It falls, then, into three divisions, each distinguished by a
particular name,&mdash;Asia, Libya, Europe.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> The boundaries are
respectively the Don, the Nile, and the Straits of the Pillars of
Hercules. Asia lies between the Don and the Nile, and lies
under that portion of the heaven which is between the north-east
and the south. Libya lies between the Nile and the Pillars
of Hercules, and falls beneath the south portion of the heaven,
extending to the south-west without a break, till it reaches the
point of the equinoctial sunset, which corresponds with the
Pillars of Hercules. These two divisions of the earth, therefore,
regarded in a general point of view, occupy all that part
which is south of the Mediterranean from east to west.
Europe with respect to both of these lies to the north facing
them, and extending continuously from east to west. Its most
important and extensive part lies under the northern sky
between the river Don and the Narbo, which is only a short
distance west of Marseilles and the mouths by which the Rhone
discharges itself into the Sardinian Sea. From Narbo is the
district occupied by the Celts as far as the Pyrenees, stretching
continuously from the Mediterranean to the Mare Externum.
The rest of Europe south of the Pyrenees, to the point where
it approaches the Pillars of Hercules, is bounded on one side
by the Mediterranean, on the other by the Mare Externum;
and that part of it which is washed by the Mediterranean as
far as the Pillars of Hercules is called Iberia, while the part
which lies along the Outer or Great Sea has no general name,
because it has but recently been discovered, and is inhabited
entirely by barbarous tribes, who are very numerous, and of
whom I will speak in more detail hereafter.</p>

<p><a name="b3_38" id="b3_38"><b>38.</b></a> But as no one up to our time has been able to settle
in regard to those parts of Asia and Libya, where they approach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
each other in the neighbourhood of Ethiopia, whether the
continent is continuous to the south, <span class="sidenote">The extreme north
and south unknown.</span>or is
surrounded by the sea, so it is in regard to the
part between Narbo and the Don: none of
us as yet knows anything of the northern extent of this
district, and anything we can ever know must be the result
of future exploration; and those who rashly venture by word
of mouth or written statements to describe this district must
be looked upon as ignorant or romancing.</p>

<p>My object in these observations was to prevent my narrative
being entirely vague to those who were unacquainted
with the localities. I hoped that, by keeping these broad
distinctions in mind, they would have some definite standard
to which to refer every mention of a place, starting from the
primary one of the division of the sky into four quarters. For,
as in the case of physical sight, we instinctively turn our faces to
any object pointed at; so in the case of the mind, our thoughts
ought to turn naturally to localities as they are mentioned
from time to time.</p>

<p>It is time now to return to the story we have in hand.</p>

<p><a name="b3_39" id="b3_39"><b>39.</b></a> At this period the Carthaginians were masters of the
whole Mediterranean coast of Libya from the Altars of
Philaenus,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> opposite the Great Syrtis, to the Pillars of Hercules,
a seaboard of over sixteen thousand stades. They had also
crossed the strait of the Pillars of Hercules, and got possession
of the whole seaboard of Iberia on the Mediterranean as far as
the Pyrenees, which separate the Iberes from the Celts&mdash;that
is, for a distance of about eight thousand stades: for it is
three thousand from the Pillars to New Carthage, from which
Hannibal started for Italy; two thousand six hundred from
thence to the Iber; and from that river to <span class="sidenote">The length of the
march from

Po, 1125 Roman

town, I may add, to the passage of the Rhone

stream along its bank of fourteen hundred stades, before reaching
the foot of the pass over the Alps into Italy. The pass
itself was about twelve hundred stades, which being crossed
would bring him into the plains of the Padus in Italy. So
that the whole length of his march from New Carthage was about
nine thousand stades, or 1125 Roman miles. Of the country
he had thus to traverse he had already passed almost half in
mere distance, but in the difficulties the greater part of his
task was still before him.</p>

at the extraordinary strength of the positions

heard the result of the embassy to Carthage,
and that Hannibal had crossed the Iber earlier

to send Publius Cornelius Scipio with his legions
into Iberia, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus
into Libya. And while the Consuls were engaged
in hastening on the enrolment of their legions and other
military preparations, the people were active in bringing to
completion the colonies which they had already voted to send
into Gaul. They accordingly caused the fortification of these
towns to be energetically pushed on, and ordered the colonists
to be in residence within thirty days: six thousand having been
assigned to each colony. One of these colonies was on the
south bank of the Padus, and was called Placentia; <span class="sidenote">Placentia and
Cremona.</span>
the other on the north bank, called
Cremona. But no sooner had these colonies
been formed, than the Boian Gauls, who had long been
lying in wait to throw off their loyalty to Rome, but had
up to that time lacked an opportunity, encouraged by the
news that reached them of Hannibal&#8217;s approach, revolted;
thus abandoning the hostages which they had given at the end
of the war described in my last book. The ill-feeling still
remaining towards Rome enabled them to induce the Insubres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
to join in the revolt; and the united tribes swept over the
territory recently allotted by the Romans, and following close
upon the track of the flying colonists, laid siege to the Roman
colony of Mutina, in which the fugitives had taken refuge.
Among them were the <i>triumviri</i> or three commissioners who
had been sent out to allot the lands, of whom one&mdash;Gaius
Lutatius&mdash;was an ex-consul, the other two ex-praetors. <span class="sidenote">Outrage by Boii

These
men having demanded a parley with the
enemy, the Boii consented: but treacherously
seized them upon their leaving the town,
hoping by their means to recover their own hostages. The
praetor Lucius Manlius was on guard in the district with an
army, and as soon as he heard what had happened, he advanced
with all speed to the relief of Mutina. But the Boii, having got
intelligence of his approach, prepared an ambuscade; and as
soon as his army had entered a certain wood, they rushed out
upon it from every side and killed a large number of his men.
The survivors at first fled with precipitation: but having gained
some higher ground, they rallied sufficiently to enable them
with much difficulty to effect an honourable retreat. Even so,
the Boii followed close upon their heels, and besieged them
in a place called the village of Tannes.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> When the news
arrived at Rome, that the fourth legion was surrounded and
closely besieged by the Boii, the people in all haste despatched
the legions which had been voted to the Consul Publius, to
their relief, under the command of a Praetor, and ordered the
Consul to enrol two more legions for himself from the allies.</p>

<p><a name="b3_41" id="b3_41"><b>41.</b></a> Such was the state of Celtic affairs from the beginning
to the arrival of Hannibal; thus completing the course of events
which I have already had occasion to describe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Consuls, having completed the necessary
preparations for their respective missions, set sail at the beginning <span class="sidenote">Tiberius

of summer&mdash;Publius to Iberia, with sixty
ships, and Tiberius Sempronius to Libya, with a
hundred and sixty quinqueremes. The latter
thought by means of this great fleet to strike
terror into the enemy; and made vast preparations at Lilybaeum,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
collecting fresh troops wherever he could get them, as
though with the view of at once blockading Carthage itself.</p>

<p>Publius Cornelius coasted along Liguria, and crossing in
five days from Pisae to Marseilles, dropped <span class="sidenote">Publius Scipio
lands near
Marseilles.</span>
anchor at the most eastern mouth of the Rhone,
called the Mouth of Marseilles,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> and began
disembarking his troops. For though he heard that Hannibal
was already crossing the Pyrenees, he felt sure that he was
still a long way off, owing to the difficulty of his line of country,
and the number of the intervening Celtic tribes. But long
before he was expected, Hannibal had arrived at the crossing
of the Rhone, keeping the Sardinian Sea on his right as he
marched, and having made his way through the Celts partly
by bribes and partly by force. Being informed that the
enemy were at hand, Publius was at first incredulous of the
fact, because of the rapidity of the advance; but wishing to
know the exact state of the case,&mdash;while staying behind himself
to refresh his troops after their voyage, and to consult with
the Tribunes as to the best ground on which to give the
enemy battle,&mdash;he sent out a reconnoitring party, consisting
of three hundred of his bravest horse; joining with them as
guides and supports some Celts, who chanced to be serving
as mercenaries at the time in Marseilles.</p>

<p><a name="b3_42" id="b3_42"><b>42.</b></a> Meanwhile Hannibal had reached the river and was
trying to get across it where the stream was
single, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal reaches
the Rhone.</span>at a distance of four days&#8217; march
from the sea. He did all he could to
make the natives living by the river friendly to him, and
purchased from them all their canoes of hollow trunks, and
wherries, of which there were a large number, owing to the
extensive sea traffic of the inhabitants of the Rhone valley.
He got from them also the timber suited to the construction
of these canoes; and so in two days had an innumerable
supply of transports, every soldier seeking to be independent
of his neighbour, and to have the means of crossing in his own
hands. But now a large multitude of barbarians collected on
the other side of the stream to hinder the passage of the Carthaginians.
When Hannibal saw them, he came to the conclusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
that it would be impossible either to force a passage in
the face of so large a body of the enemy, or to remain where
he was, for fear of being attacked on all sides at once: and
he accordingly, on the third night, sent forward a detachment
of his army with native guides, under the command of Hanno,
the son of the Suffete<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> Bomilcar. <span class="sidenote">A detachment
crosses higher up
the river.</span>This force
marched up stream along the bank for two
hundred stades, until they arrived at a certain
spot where the stream is divided by an eyot, and there
halted. They found enough wood close at hand to enable
them, by nailing or tying it together, to construct within a
short time a large number of rafts good enough for temporary
use; and on these they crossed in safety, without any one trying
to stop them. Then, seizing upon a strong position, they kept
quiet for the rest of the day: partly to refresh themselves after
their fatigues, and at the same time to complete their preparations
for the service awaiting them, as they had been ordered
to do. Hannibal was preparing to proceed much in the
same way with the forces left behind with himself; but his
chief difficulty was in getting the elephants across, of which he
had thirty-seven.</p>

<p><a name="b3_43" id="b3_43"><b>43.</b></a> When the fifth night came, however, the division
which had crossed first started before daybreak <span class="sidenote">The crossing
begun.</span>
to march down the opposite bank of
the river and attack the barbarians; while
Hannibal, having his men in readiness, began to attempt the
passage of the river. He had filled the wherries with the heavy-armed
cavalry, and the canoes with the most active of his foot;
and he now arranged that the wherries should cross higher up
the stream, and the canoes below them, that the violence of
the current might be broken by the former, and the canoes
cross more safely. The plan for the horses was that they
should swim at the stern of the wherries, one man on each
side of the stern guiding three or four with leading reins: so
that a considerable number of horses were brought over at
once with the first detachment. When they saw what the
enemy meant to do, the barbarians, without forming their
ranks, poured out of their entrenchments in scattered groups,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>feeling no doubt of being able to stop the crossing of the
Carthaginians with ease. As soon as Hannibal saw by the
smoke, which was the signal agreed upon, that the advanced
detachment on the other side was approaching, he ordered
all to go on board, and the men in charge of the transports to
push out against the stream. This was promptly done: and
then began a most anxious and exciting scene. Cheer after
cheer rose from the men who were working the boats, as they
struggled to outstrip each other, and exerted themselves to the
utmost to overcome the force of the current. On the edge of
either bank stood the two armies: the one sharing in the struggles
of their comrades by sympathy, and shouting encouragement
to them as they went; while the barbarians in front of them
yelled their war-cries and challenged them to battle. While
this was going on the barbarians had abandoned their tents,
which the Carthaginians on that side of the river suddenly
and unexpectedly seized. Some of them proceeded to set fire
to the camp, while the greater number went to attack the men
who were standing ready to resist the passage. Surprised by
this unlooked-for event, some of the barbarians rushed off to
save their tents, while others prepared to resist the attack of
the enemy, and were now actually engaged. Seeing that
everything was going as he had intended, Hannibal at once
formed the first division as it disembarked: and after addressing
some encouraging words to it, closed with the barbarians, who,
having no time to form their ranks, and being taken by surprise,
were quickly repulsed and put to flight.</p>

<p><a name="b3_44" id="b3_44"><b>44.</b></a> Being thus master of the passage of the river, and
victorious over those who opposed him, <span class="sidenote">Completed</span>the
first care of the Carthaginian leader was
to bring his whole army across. This being expeditiously
accomplished, he pitched his camp for that night by the
river-side, and on the morrow, when he was told that the
Roman fleet was anchored off the mouths of the river,
he detached five hundred Numidian horsemen to reconnoitre
the enemy and find out their position, their numbers, and what
they were going to do; and at the same time selected suitable
men to manage the passage of the elephants. These arrangements
made, he summoned a meeting of his army and introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Magilus and the other chiefs who had come to him
from the valley of the Padus, and caused them to
declare to the whole army, <span class="sidenote">Message from
friendly Gauls.</span>
by means of an interpreter,
the resolutions passed by their tribes.
The points which were the strongest encouragement to the army
were, first, the actual appearance of envoys inviting them to come,
and promising to take part in the war with Rome; secondly,
the confidence inspired by their promise of guiding them by a
route where they would be abundantly supplied with necessaries,
and which would lead them with speed and safety into Italy;
and, lastly, the fertility and vast extent of the country to which
they were going, and the friendly feelings of the men with whose
assistance they were about to fight the armies of Rome.</p>

<p>Such was the substance of the speeches of the Celts.
When they had withdrawn, Hannibal himself rose, and after
reminding the soldiers of what they had already achieved,
and pointing out that, though they had under his counsel and
advice engaged in many perilous and dangerous enterprises,
they had never failed in one, he bade them &#8220;not lose
courage now that the most serious part of their undertaking
was accomplished. The Rhone was crossed: they had seen
with their own eyes the display of goodwill and zeal of their
allies. Let this convince them that they should leave the rest
to him with confidence; and while obeying his orders show
themselves men of courage and worthy of their former deeds.&#8221;
These words being received with shouts of approval, and other
manifestations of great enthusiasm, on the part of the soldiers,
Hannibal dismissed the assembly with words of praise to the
men and a prayer to the gods on their behalf; after giving
out an order that they should refresh themselves, and make
all their preparations with despatch, as the advance must
begin on the morrow.</p>

<p><a name="b3_45" id="b3_45"><b>45.</b></a> When the assembly had been dismissed, the reconnoitring
party of Numidians returned in headlong
flight, <span class="sidenote">Skirmish between
reconnoitring
parties.</span>after losing more than half their
numbers. Not far from the camp they had
fallen in with a party of Roman horse, who had been
sent out by Publius on the same errand; and an engagement
took place with such fury on either side, that the Romans and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Celts lost a hundred and forty men, and the Numidians more
than two hundred. After this skirmish, the Romans pursued
them up to the Carthaginian entrenchments: and having surveyed
it, they hastened back to announce to the Consul the
presence of the enemy. As soon as they arrived at the Roman
camp with this intelligence, Publius put his baggage on board
ship, and marched his men up the bank of the river, with the
earnest desire of forcing the enemy to give him battle.</p>

<p>But at sunrise on the day after the assembly, Hannibal
having stationed his whole cavalry on the rear, in the direction
of the sea, so as to cover the advance, ordered his infantry to
leave the entrenchment and begin their march; while he himself
waited behind for the elephants, and the men who had not
yet crossed the river.</p>

<p><a name="b3_46" id="b3_46"><b>46.</b></a> The mode of getting the elephants across was as
follows. They made a number of rafts
strongly compacted, <span class="sidenote">The passage of
the elephants.</span>
which they lashed firmly
two and two together, so as to form combined
a breadth of about fifty feet, and brought them close under
the bank at the place of crossing. To the outer edge of
these they lashed some others and made them join exactly;
so that the whole raft thus constructed stretched out some
way into the channel, while the edges towards the stream were
made fast to the land with ropes tied to trees which grew along
the brink, to secure the raft keeping its place and not drifting
down the river. These combined rafts stretching about
two hundred feet across the stream, they joined two other very
large ones to the outer edges, fastened very firmly together, but
connected with the others by ropes which admitted of being
easily cut. To these they fastened several towing lines, that
the wherries might prevent the rafts drifting down stream, and
might drag them forcibly against the current and so get the
elephants across on them. Then they threw a great deal of
earth upon all the rafts, until they had raised the surface to the
level of the bank, and made it look like the path on the land
leading down to the passage. The elephants were accustomed
to obey their Indian riders until they came to water, but could
never be induced to step into water: they therefore led them
upon this earth, putting two females in front whom the others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
obediently followed. When they had set foot on the rafts
that were farthest out in the stream, the ropes were cut which
fastened these to the other rafts, the towing lines were pulled
taut by the wherries, and the elephants, with the rafts on
which they stood, were quickly towed away from the mound of
earth. When this happened, the animals were terror-stricken;
and at first turned round and round, and rushed first to one
part of the raft and then to another, but finding themselves
completely surrounded by the water, they were too frightened
to do anything, and were obliged to stay where they were.
And it was by repeating this contrivance of joining a pair of
rafts to the others, that eventually the greater part of the
elephants were got across. Some of them, however, in the
middle of the crossing, threw themselves in their terror into
the river: but though their Indian riders were drowned, the
animals themselves got safe to land, saved by the strength and
great length of their probosces; for by raising these above the
water, they were enabled to breathe through them, and blow out
any water that got into them, while for the most part they got
through the river on their feet.</p>

<p><a name="b3_47" id="b3_47"><b>47.</b></a> The elephants having been thus got across, Hannibal
formed them and the cavalry into a rear-guard, and marched
up the river bank away from the sea in an easterly direction, as
though making for the central district of Europe.</p>

<p>The Rhone rises to the north-west of the Adriatic Gulf on
the northern slopes of the Alps,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and flowing westward, eventually
discharges itself into the Sardinian Sea. It flows for the
most part through a deep valley, to the north of which lives the
Celtic tribe of the Ardyes; while its southern side is entirely
walled in by the northern slopes of the Alps, the ridges of
which, beginning at Marseilles and extending to the head of
the Adriatic, separate it from the valley of the Padus, of which
I have already had occasion to speak at length. It was these
mountains that Hannibal now crossed from the Rhone valley
into Italy.</p>

<p>Some historians of this passage of the Alps, in their desire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>to produce a striking effect by their descriptions of the wonders
of this country, have fallen into two errors which are more
alien than anything else to the spirit of history,&mdash;perversion of
fact and inconsistency. Introducing Hannibal as a prodigy of
strategic skill and boldness, they yet represent him as acting
with the most conspicuous indiscretion; and then, finding
themselves involved in an inextricable maze of falsehood, they
try to cut the knot by the introduction of gods and heroes
into what is meant to be genuine history. They begin by
saying that the Alps are so precipitous and inaccessible that, so
far from horses and troops, accompanied too by elephants,
being able to cross them, it would be very difficult for even
active men on foot to do so: and similarly they tell us that
the desolation of this district is so complete, that, had not some
god or hero met Hannibal&#8217;s forces and showed them the way,
they would have been hopelessly lost and perished to a man.</p>

<p>Such stories involve both the errors I have mentioned,&mdash;they
are both false and inconsistent.</p>

<p><a name="b3_48" id="b3_48"><b>48.</b></a> For could a more irrational proceeding on the part of a
general be imagined than that of Hannibal, if, when in command
of so numerous an army, on whom the success of his
expedition entirely depended, he allowed himself to remain in
ignorance of the roads, the lie of the country, the route to be
taken, and the people to which it led, and above all as to the
practicability of what he was undertaking to do? They, in
fact, represent Hannibal, when at the height of his expectation
of success, doing what those would hardly do who have utterly
failed and have been reduced to despair,&mdash;that is, to entrust
themselves and their forces to an unknown country. And so,
too, what they say about the desolation of the district, and its
precipitous and inaccessible character, only serves to bring their
untrustworthiness into clearer light. For first, they pass over
the fact that the Celts of the Rhone valley had on several
occasions before Hannibal came, and that in very recent times,
crossed the Alps with large forces, and fought battles with the
Romans in alliance with the Celts of the valley of the Padus, as
I have already stated. And secondly, they are unaware of the
fact that a very numerous tribe of people inhabit the Alps.
Accordingly in their ignorance of these facts they take refuge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
in the assertion that a hero showed Hannibal the way. They
are, in fact, in the same case as tragedians, who, beginning
with an improbable and impossible plot, are obliged to bring
in a <i>deus ex machina</i> to solve the difficulty and end the play.
The absurd premises of these historians naturally require some
such supernatural agency to help them out of the difficulty:
an absurd beginning could only have an absurd ending. For
of course Hannibal did not act as these writers say he did;
but, on the contrary, conducted his plans with the utmost prudence.
He had thoroughly informed himself of the fertility of
the country into which he designed to descend, and of the
hostile feelings of its inhabitants towards Rome, and for his
journey through the difficult district which intervened he
employed native guides and pioneers, whose interests were
bound up with his own. I speak with confidence on these
points, because I have questioned persons actually engaged on
the facts, and have inspected the country, and gone over the
Alpine pass myself, in order to inform myself of the truth and
see with my own eyes.</p>

<p><a name="b3_49" id="b3_49"><b>49.</b></a> Three days after Hannibal had resumed his march, the
Consul Publius arrived at the passage of the
river. <span class="sidenote">Scipio finds that
Hannibal has
escaped him.</span>He was in the highest degree astonished
to find the enemy gone: for he had persuaded
himself that they would never venture to take this route into
Italy, on account of the numbers and fickleness of the barbarians
who inhabited the country. But seeing that they had
done so, he hurried back to his ships and at once embarked
his forces. He then despatched his brother Gnaeus to conduct
the campaign in Iberia, while he himself turned back again
to Italy by sea, being anxious to anticipate the enemy by
marching through Etruria to the foot of the pass of the Alps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after four days&#8217; march from the passage of the
Rhone, Hannibal arrived at the place called
the Island, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal&#8217;s
march to the foot
of the Alps.</span>a district thickly inhabited and
exceedingly productive of corn. Its name is
derived from its natural features: for the Rhone and Isara
flowing on either side of it make the apex of a triangle where
they meet, very nearly of the same size and shape as the delta
of the Nile, except that the base of the latter is formed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
sea into which its various streams are discharged, while in the
case of the former this base is formed by mountains difficult
to approach or climb, and, so to speak, almost inaccessible.
When Hannibal arrived in this district he found two brothers
engaged in a dispute for the royal power, and confronting each
other with their armies. The elder sought his alliance and
invited his assistance in gaining the crown: and the advantage
which such a circumstance might prove to him at that
juncture of his affairs being manifest, he consented; and
having joined him in his attack upon his brother, and aided in
expelling him, he obtained valuable support from the victorious
chieftain. For this prince not only liberally supplied his army
with provisions, but exchanged all their old and damaged
weapons for new ones, and thus at a very opportune time
thoroughly restored the efficiency of the troops: he also gave
most of the men new clothes and boots, which proved of great
advantage during their passage of the mountains. But his
most essential service was that, the Carthaginians being greatly
alarmed at the prospect of marching through the territory of
the Allobroges, he acted with his army as their rear-guard, and
secured them a safe passage as far as the foot of the pass.</p>

<p><a name="b3_50" id="b3_50"><b>50.</b></a> Having in ten days&#8217; march accomplished a distance
of eight hundred stades along the river bank, <span class="sidenote">The ascent.</span>
Hannibal began the ascent of the Alps,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> and
immediately found himself involved in the most serious
dangers. For as long as the Carthaginians were on the
plains, the various chiefs of the Allobroges refrained from
attacking them from fear of their cavalry, as well as of the
Gauls who were escorting them. But when these last departed
back again to their own lands, and Hannibal began to enter the
mountainous region, the chiefs of the Allobroges collected
large numbers of their tribe and occupied the points of vantage
in advance, on the route by which Hannibal&#8217;s troops were
constrained to make their ascent. If they had only kept their
design secret, the Carthaginian army would have been entirely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>destroyed: as it was, their plans became known, and though
they did much damage to Hannibal&#8217;s army, they suffered as
much themselves. For when that general learnt that the
natives were occupying the points of vantage, he halted and
pitched his camp at the foot of the pass, and sent forward
some of his Gallic guides to reconnoitre the enemy and discover
their plan of operations. The order was obeyed: and
he ascertained that it was the enemy&#8217;s practice to keep under
arms, and guard these posts carefully, during the day, but at
night to retire to some town in the neighbourhood. Hannibal
accordingly adapted his measures to this strategy of the enemy.
He marched forward in broad daylight, and as soon as he
came to the mountainous part of the road, pitched his camp
only a little way from the enemy. At nightfall he gave orders
for the watch-fires to be lit; and leaving the main body of his
troops in the camp, and selecting the most suitable of his men,
he had them armed lightly, and led them through the narrow
parts of the road during the night, and seized on the spots
which had been previously occupied by the enemy: they having,
according to their regular custom, abandoned them for the
nearest town.</p>

<p><a name="b3_51" id="b3_51"><b>51.</b></a> When day broke the natives saw what had taken place,
and at first desisted from their attempts; <span class="sidenote">The Gauls harass
the army.</span>
but presently the sight of the immense string
of beasts of burden, and of the cavalry, slowly
and painfully making the ascent, tempted them to attack
the advancing line. Accordingly they fell upon it at many
points at once; and the Carthaginians sustained severe
losses, not so much at the hands of the enemy, as from the
dangerous nature of the ground, which proved especially fatal
to the horses and beasts of burden. For as the ascent was
not only narrow and rough, but flanked also with precipices,
at every movement which tended to throw the line into disorder,
large numbers of the beasts of burden were hurled down
the precipices with their loads on their backs. And what
added more than anything else to this sort of confusion were
the wounded horses; for, maddened by their wounds, they
either turned round and ran into the advancing beasts of
burden, or, rushing furiously forward, dashed aside everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
that came in their way on the narrow path, and so threw the
whole line into disorder. Hannibal saw what was taking
place, and knowing that, even if they escaped this attack, they
could never survive the loss of all their baggage, he took with
him the men who had seized the strongholds during the night
and went to the relief of the advancing line. Having the
advantage of charging the enemy from the higher ground he
inflicted a severe loss upon them, but suffered also as severe
a one in his own army; for the commotion in the line now
grew worse, and in both directions at once&mdash;thanks to the
shouting and struggling of these combatants: and it was not
until he had killed the greater number of the Allobroges, and
forced the rest to fly to their own land, that the remainder of
the beasts of burden and the horses got slowly, and with difficulty,
over the dangerous ground. Hannibal himself rallied
as many as he could after the fight, and assaulted the town
from which the enemy had sallied; and finding it almost
deserted, because its inhabitants had been all tempted out
by the hope of booty, he got possession of it: from which he
obtained many advantages for the future as well as for the
present. The immediate gain consisted of a large number of
horses and beasts of burden, and men taken with them; and
for future use he got a supply of corn and cattle sufficient for
two or three days: but the most important result of all was the
terror inspired in the next tribes, which prevented any one of
those who lived near the ascent from lightly venturing to meddle
with him again.</p>

<p><a name="b3_52" id="b3_52"><b>52.</b></a> Here he pitched a camp and remained a day, and
started again. For the next three days <span class="sidenote">Treachery of the
Gauls.</span>
he accomplished a certain amount of his
journey without accident. But on the fourth
he again found himself in serious danger. For the dwellers
along his route, having concerted a plan of treachery, met
him with branches and garlands, which among nearly all
the natives are signs of friendship, as the herald&#8217;s staff is
among the Greeks. Hannibal was cautious about accepting
such assurances, and took great pains to discover what their
real intention and purpose were. The Gauls however professed
to be fully aware of the capture of the town, and the destruction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
of those who had attempted to do him wrong; and explained
that those events had induced them to come, because they
wished neither to inflict nor receive any damage; and finally
promised to give him hostages. For a long while Hannibal
hesitated and refused to trust their speeches. But at length
coming to the conclusion that, if he accepted what was offered,
he would perhaps render the men before him less mischievous
and implacable; but that, if he rejected them, he must expect
undisguised hostility from them, he acceded to their request,
and feigned to accept their offer of friendship. The barbarians
handed over the hostages, supplied him liberally with
cattle, and in fact put themselves unreservedly into his hands;
so that for a time Hannibal&#8217;s suspicions were allayed, and he
employed them as guides for the next difficulty that had to be
passed. They guided the army for two days: and then these
tribes collected their numbers, and keeping close up with the
Carthaginians, attacked them just as they were passing through
a certain difficult and precipitous gorge.</p>

<p><a name="b3_53" id="b3_53"><b>53.</b></a> Hannibal&#8217;s army would now have certainly been utterly
destroyed, had it not been for the fact that his <span class="sidenote">Severe losses.</span>
fears were still on the alert, and that, having a
prescience of what was to come, he had placed his baggage and
cavalry in the van and his hoplites in the rear. These latter
covered his line, and were able to stem the attack of the enemy,
and accordingly the disaster was less than it would otherwise
have been. As it was, however, a large number of beasts of
burden and horses perished; for the advantage of the higher
ground being with the enemy, the Gauls moved along the
slopes parallel with the army below, and by rolling down
boulders, or throwing stones, reduced the troops to a state of
the utmost confusion and danger; so that Hannibal with half
his force was obliged to pass the night near a certain white rock,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>
which afforded them protection, separated from his horses and
baggage which he was covering; until after a whole night&#8217;s
struggle they slowly and with difficulty emerged from the gorge.</p>

<p>Next morning the enemy had disappeared: and Hannibal,
having effected a junction with his cavalry and baggage, led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
his men towards the head of the pass, without falling in
again with any important muster of the natives, <span class="sidenote">Arrives at the
summit.</span>
though he was harassed by some of them
from time to time; who seized favourable
opportunities, now on his van and now on his rear, of
carrying off some of his baggage. His best protection
was his elephants; on whatever parts of the line they
were placed the enemy never ventured to approach, being
terrified at the unwonted appearance of the animals. The
ninth day&#8217;s march brought him to the head of the pass:
and there he encamped for two days, partly to rest his men
and partly to allow stragglers to come up. Whilst they were
there, many of the horses who had taken fright and run away,
and many of the beasts of burden that had got rid of their
loads, unexpectedly appeared: they had followed the tracks of
the army and now joined the camp.</p>

<p><a name="b3_54" id="b3_54"><b>54.</b></a> But by this time, it being nearly the period of the
setting of the Pleiads, the snow was beginning <span class="sidenote">9th November.</span>
to be thick on the heights; and seeing his men
in low spirits, owing both to the fatigue they had gone through,
and that which still lay before them, Hannibal called them
together and tried to cheer them by dwelling on the one possible
topic of consolation in his power, namely the view of Italy:
which lay stretched out in both directions below those mountains,
giving the Alps the appearance of a citadel to the whole
of Italy. By pointing therefore to the plains of the Padus, and
reminding them of the friendly welcome which awaited them
from the Gauls who lived there, and at the same time indicating
the direction of Rome itself, he did somewhat to raise the
drooping spirits of his men.</p>

<p>Next day he began the descent, in which he no longer
met with any enemies, except some few secret
pillagers; <span class="sidenote">The descent.</span>but from the dangerous ground and
the snow he lost almost as many men as on the
ascent. For the path down was narrow and precipitous,
and the snow made it impossible for the men to
see where they were treading, while to step aside from the
path, or to stumble, meant being hurled down the precipices.
The troops however bore up against the fatigue, having now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
grown accustomed to such hardships; but when they came to
a place where the path was too narrow for the elephants or
beasts of burden to pass,&mdash;and which, narrowed before by
landslips extending about a stade and a half, had recently
been made more so by another landslip,&mdash;then once more
despondency and consternation fell upon the troops. Hannibal&#8217;s
first idea was to avoid this <i>mauvais pas</i> by a detour, but
this route too being made impossible by a snow-storm, he
abandoned the idea.</p>

<p><a name="b3_55" id="b3_55"><b>55.</b></a> The effect of the storm was peculiar and extraordinary.
For the present fall of snow coming <span class="sidenote">A break in the
road.</span>
upon the top of that which was there before,
and had remained from the last winter, it was
found that the former, being fresh, was soft and offered no
resistance to the foot; but when the feet reached the lower
frozen snow, they could no longer make any impression upon
it, but the men found both their feet slipping from under
them, as though they were on hard ground with a layer
of mud on the top. And a still more serious difficulty
followed: for not being able to get a foothold on the lower
snow, when they fell and tried to get themselves up by their
hands and knees, the men found themselves plunging downwards
quicker and quicker, along with everything they laid hold
of, the ground being a very steep decline. The beasts, however,
when they fell did break through this lower snow as they
struggled to rise, and having done so were obliged to remain
there with their loads, as though they were frozen to it, both
from the weight of these loads and the hardness of the old snow.
Giving up, therefore, all hope of making this detour, he encamped
upon the ridge after clearing away the snow upon it.
He then set large parties of his men to work, and, with infinite
toil, began constructing a road on the face of the precipice.
One day&#8217;s work sufficed to make a path practicable for beasts
of burden and horses; and he accordingly took them across
at once, and having pitched his camp at a spot below the snow
line, he let them go in search of pasture; while he told off the
Numidians in detachments to proceed with the making of the
road; and after three days&#8217; difficult and painful labour he got
his elephants across, though in a miserable condition from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
hunger. For the tops of the Alps, and the parts immediately
below them, are completely treeless and bare of vegetation,
because the snow lies there summer and winter; but about
half-way down the slopes on both sides they produce trees and
shrubs, and are, in fact, fit for human habitation.</p>

<p><a name="b3_56" id="b3_56"><b>56.</b></a> So Hannibal mustered his forces and continued the
descent; and on the third day after passing <span class="sidenote">He reaches the
plains.</span>
the precipitous path just described he reached
the plains. From the beginning of his march
he had lost many men by the hands of the enemy, and
in crossing rivers, and many more on the precipices and
dangerous passes of the Alps; and not only men in this
last way, but horses and beasts of burden in still greater
numbers. The whole march from New Carthage had occupied
five months, the actual passage of the Alps fifteen days; and he
now boldly entered the valley of the Padus, and the territory of
the Insubres, with such of his army as survived, consisting of
twelve thousand Libyans and eight thousand Iberians, and
not more than six thousand cavalry in all, as he himself
distinctly states on the column erected on the promontory of
Lacinium to record the numbers.</p>

<p>At the same time, as I have before stated, Publius having left
his legions under the command of his brother Gnaeus, with
orders to prosecute the Iberian campaign and offer an energetic
resistance to Hasdrubal, landed at Pisae with a small body of
men. Thence he marched through Etruria, and taking over
the army of the Praetors which was guarding the country against
the Boii, he arrived in the valley of the Padus; and, pitching
his camp there, waited for the enemy with an eager desire to
give him battle.</p>

<p><a name="b3_57" id="b3_57"><b>57.</b></a> Having thus brought the generals of the two nations
and the war itself into Italy, before beginning <span class="sidenote">Digression on the
limits of history.</span>
the campaign, I wish to say a few words about
what I conceive to be germane or not to
my history.</p>

<p>I can conceive some readers complaining that, while
devoting a great deal of space to Libya and Iberia, I have said
little or nothing about the strait of the Pillars of Hercules, the
Mare Externum, or the British Isles, and the manufacture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
tin in them, or even of the silver and gold mines in Iberia itself,
of which historians give long and contradictory accounts. It was
not, let me say, because I thought these subjects out of place in
history that I passed them over; but because, in the first place,
I did not wish to be diffuse, or distract the attention of students
from the main current of my narrative; and, in the next place,
because I was determined not to treat of them in scattered
notices or casual allusions, but to assign them a distinct time
and place, and at these, to the best of my ability, to give a trustworthy
account of them. On the same principle I must
deprecate any feeling of surprise if, in the succeeding portions
of my history, I pass over other similar topics, which might
seem naturally in place, for the same reasons. Those who ask
for dissertations in history on every possible subject, are somewhat
like greedy guests at a banquet, who, by tasting every
dish on the table, fail to really enjoy any one of them at the
time, or to digest and feel any benefit from them afterwards.
Such omnivorous readers get no real pleasure in the present,
and no adequate instruction for the future.</p>

<p><a name="b3_58" id="b3_58"><b>58.</b></a> There can be no clearer proof, than is afforded by these
particular instances, that this department of historical writing
stands above all others in need of study and correction. For
as all, or at least the greater number of writers, have endeavoured
to describe the peculiar features and positions of the countries
on the confines of the known world, and in doing so have,
in most cases, made egregious mistakes, it is impossible to
pass over their errors without some attempt at refutation; and
that not in scattered observations or casual remarks, but
deliberately and formally. But such confutation should not
take the form of accusation or invective. While correcting
their mistakes we should praise the writers, feeling sure that,
had they lived to the present age, they would have altered and
corrected many of their statements. The fact is that, in past
ages, we know of very few Greeks who undertook to investigate
these remote regions, owing to the insuperable difficulties of the
attempt. The dangers at sea were then more than can easily be
calculated, and those on land more numerous still. And even
if one did reach these countries on the confines of the world,
whether compulsorily or voluntarily, the difficulties in the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
of a personal inspection were only begun: for some of the
regions were utterly barbarous, others uninhabited; and a still
greater obstacle in way of gaining information as to what he
saw was his ignorance of the language of the country. And
even if he learnt this, a still greater difficulty was to preserve
a strict moderation in his account of what he had seen, and
despising all attempts to glorify himself by traveller&#8217;s tales of
wonder, to report for our benefit the truth and nothing but the
truth.</p>

<p><a name="b3_59" id="b3_59"><b>59.</b></a> All these impediments made a true account of these
regions in past times difficult, if not impossible. Nor ought we
to criticise severely the omissions or mistakes of these writers:
rather they deserve our praise and admiration for having in
such an age gained information as to these places, which
distinctly advanced knowledge. In our own age, however,
the Asiatic districts have been opened up both by sea and
land owing to the empire of Alexander, and the other places
owing to the supremacy of Rome. Men too of practical
experience in affairs, being released from the cares of martial or
political ambition, have thereby had excellent opportunities for
research and inquiry into these localities; and therefore it will
be but right for us to have a better and truer knowledge of
what was formerly unknown. And this I shall endeavour to
establish, when I find a fitting opportunity in the course of my
history. I shall be especially anxious to give the curious a
full knowledge on these points, because it was with that express
object that I confronted the dangers and fatigues of my travels
in Libya, Iberia, and Gaul, as well as of the sea which washes
the western coasts of these countries; that I might correct the
imperfect knowledge of former writers, and make the Greeks
acquainted with these parts of the known world.</p>

<p>After this digression, I must go back to the pitched
battles between the Romans and Carthaginians in Italy.</p>

<p><a name="b3_60" id="b3_60"><b>60.</b></a> After arriving in Italy with the number of troops
which I have already stated, <span class="sidenote">Rest and recovery.</span>
Hannibal pitched
his camp at the very foot of the Alps, and
was occupied, to begin with, in refreshing his men. For
not only had his whole army suffered terribly from the
difficulties of transit in the ascent, and still more in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
descent of the Alps, but it was also in evil case from the
shortness of provisions, and the inevitable neglect of all
proper attention to physical necessities. Many had quite
abandoned all care for their health under the influence of
starvation and continuous fatigue; for it had proved impossible
to carry a full supply of food for so many thousands over such
mountains, and what they did bring was in great part lost along
with the beasts that carried it. So that whereas, when
Hannibal crossed the Rhone, he had thirty-eight thousand
infantry, and more than eight thousand cavalry, he lost nearly
half in the pass, as I have shown above; while the survivors
had by these long continued sufferings become almost savage
in look and general appearance. Hannibal therefore bent his
whole energies to the restoration of the spirits and bodies of
his men, and of their horses also. When his army had thus
sufficiently recovered, finding the Taurini, <span class="sidenote">Taking of Turin.</span>
who
live immediately under the Alps, at war with
the Insubres and inclined to be suspicious of the Carthaginians,
Hannibal first invited them to terms of friendship
and alliance; and, on their refusal, invested their chief city
and carried it after a three day&#8217;s siege. Having put to the
sword all who had opposed him, he struck such terror into the
minds of the neighbouring tribes, that they all gave in their
submission out of hand. The other Celts inhabiting these
plains were also eager to join the Carthaginians, according to
their original purpose; but the Roman legions had by this time
advanced too far, and had intercepted the greater part of them:
they were therefore unable to stir, and in some cases were even
obliged to serve in the Roman ranks. This determined
Hannibal not to delay his advance any longer, but to strike
some blow which might encourage those natives who were
desirous of sharing his enterprise.</p>

<p><a name="b3_61" id="b3_61"><b>61.</b></a> When he heard, while engaged on this design, that Publius
had already crossed the Padus with his army, <span class="sidenote">Approach of
Scipio.</span>
and was at no great distance, he was at first inclined
to disbelieve the fact, reflecting that it was
not many days since he had left him near the passage of the
Rhone, and that the voyage from Marseilles to Etruria was a
long and difficult one. He was told, moreover, that from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Tyrrhenian Sea to the Alps through Italian soil was a long
march, without good military roads. But when messenger after
messenger confirmed the intelligence with increased positiveness,
he was filled with amazement and admiration at the
Consul&#8217;s plan of campaign, and promptness in carrying it out.
The feelings of Publius were much the same: for he had not
expected that Hannibal would even attempt the passage of the
Alps with forces of different races, or, if he did attempt it,
that he could escape utter destruction. Entertaining such ideas
he was immensely astonished at his courage and adventurous
daring, when he heard that he had not only got safe across,
but was actually besieging certain towns in Italy. Similar
feelings were entertained at Rome when the news arrived
there. For scarcely had the last rumour about the taking of
Saguntum by the Carthaginians ceased to attract attention, and
scarcely had the measures adopted in view of that event been
taken,&mdash;namely the despatch of one Consul to Libya to besiege
Carthage, and of the other to Iberia to meet Hannibal there,&mdash;than
news came that Hannibal had arrived in Italy with his
army, and was already besieging certain towns in it. Thrown
into great alarm by this unexpected turn of affairs, the Roman
government sent at once to Tiberius at Lilybaeum, telling him
of the presence of the enemy in Italy, <span class="sidenote">Tiberius Sempronius
recalled.</span>
and
ordering him to abandon the original design
of his expedition, and to make all haste home
to reinforce the defences of the country. Tiberius at once
collected the men of the fleet and sent them off, with orders
to go home by sea; while he caused the Tribunes to administer
an oath to the men of the legions that they would all
appear at a fixed day at Ariminum by bedtime. Ariminum
is a town on the Adriatic, situated at the southern boundary
of the valley of the Padus. In every direction there was stir
and excitement: and the news being a complete surprise to
everybody, there was everywhere a great and irrepressible
anxiety as to the future.</p>

<p><a name="b3_62" id="b3_62"><b>62.</b></a> The two armies being now within a short distance of
each other, Hannibal and Publius both thought <span class="sidenote">Gallic prisoners.</span>
it necessary to address their men in terms
suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>The manner in which Hannibal tried to encourage his army
was this. He mustered the men, and caused some youthful
prisoners whom he had caught when they were attempting
to hinder his march on the Alpine passes, to be brought
forward. They had been subjected to great severities
with this very object, loaded with heavy chains, half-starved,
and their bodies a mass of bruises from scourging. Hannibal
caused these men to be placed in the middle of the
army, and some suits of Gallic armour, such as are worn by
their kings when they fight in single combat, to be exhibited;
in addition to these he placed there some horses, and brought
in some valuable military cloaks. He then asked these young
prisoners, which of them were willing to fight with each other
on condition of the conqueror taking these prizes, and the
vanquished escaping all his present miseries by death. Upon
their all answering with a loud shout that they were desirous
of fighting in these single combats, he bade them draw lots;
and the pair, on whom the first lot fell, to put on the armour
and fight with each other. As soon as the young men heard
these orders, they lifted up their hands, and each prayed the
gods that he might be one of those to draw the lot. And
when the lots were drawn, those on whom they fell were overjoyed,
and the others in despair. When the fight was finished,
too, the surviving captives congratulated the one who had
fallen no less than the victor, as having been freed from many
terrible sufferings, while they themselves still remained to endure
them. And in this feeling the Carthaginian soldiers were
much disposed to join, all pitying the survivors and congratulating
the fallen champion.</p>

<p><a name="b3_63" id="b3_63"><b>63.</b></a> Having by this example made the impression he desired
upon the minds of his troops, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal&#8217;s
speech.</span>
Hannibal
then came forward himself and said, &#8220;that he
had exhibited these captives in order that they
might see in the person of others a vivid representation of
what they had to expect themselves, and might so lay their plans
all the better in view of the actual state of affairs. Fortune
had summoned them to a life and death contest very like that
of the two captives, and in which the prize of victory was the
same. For they must either conquer, or die, or fall alive into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
the hands of their enemies; and the prize of victory would not
be mere horses and military cloaks, but the most enviable position
in the world if they became masters of the wealth of Rome:
or if they fell in battle their reward would be to end their
life fighting to their last breath for the noblest object, in the
heat of the struggle, and with no sense of pain; while if they
were beaten, or from desire of life were base enough to fly, or
tried to prolong that life by any means except victory, every
sort of misery and misfortune would be their lot: for it was
impossible that any one of them could be so irrational or
senseless, when he remembered the length of the journey he
had performed from his native land, and the number of
enemies that lay between him and it, and the size of the
rivers he had crossed, as to cherish the hope of being able
to reach his home by flight. They should therefore cast away
such vain hopes, and regard their position as being exactly
that of the combatants whom they had but now been watching.
For, as in their case, all congratulated the dead as much as the
victor, and commiserated the survivors; so they should think
of the alternatives before themselves, and should, one and all,
come upon the field of battle resolved, if possible, to conquer,
and, if not, to die. Life with defeat was a hope that must
by no means whatever be entertained. If they reasoned
and resolved thus, victory and safety would certainly attend
them: for it never happened that men who came to such
a resolution, whether of deliberate purpose or from being
driven to bay, were disappointed in their hope of beating their
opponents in the field. And when it chanced, as was the
case with the Romans, that the enemy had in most cases a
hope of quite an opposite character, from the near neighbourhood
of their native country making flight an obvious means
of safety, then it was clear that the courage which came of
despair would carry the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he saw that the example and the words he had
spoken had gone home to the minds of the rank and file, and
that the spirit and enthusiasm which he aimed at inspiring
were created, he dismissed them for the present with commendations,
and gave orders for an advance at daybreak on
the next morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b3_64" id="b3_64"><b>64.</b></a> About the same day Publius Scipio, having now
crossed the Padus, and being resolved to make <span class="sidenote">Scipio crosses
the Ticinus.</span>
a farther advance across the Ticinus, ordered
those who were skilled in such works to construct
a bridge across this latter river; and then summoned
a meeting of the remainder of his army and addressed them:
dwelling principally on the reputation of their country and of
the ancestors&#8217; achievements. But he referred particularly to
their present position, saying, &#8220;that they ought to entertain no
doubt of victory, though they had never as yet had any experience
of the enemy; and should regard it as a piece of
extravagant presumption of the Carthaginians to venture to face
Romans, by whom they had been so often beaten, and to
whom they had for so many years paid tribute and been all
but slaves. And when in addition to this they at present
knew thus much of their mettle,&mdash;that they dared not face
them, what was the fair inference to be drawn for the future?
Their cavalry, in a chance encounter on the Rhone with those
of Rome, had, so far from coming off well, lost a large number
of men, and had fled with disgrace to their own camp; and the
general and his army, as soon as they knew of the approach
of his legions, had beat a retreat, which was exceedingly like a
flight, and, contrary to their original purpose, had in their
terror taken the road over the Alps. And it was evident that
Hannibal had destroyed the greater part of his army; and that
what he had left was feeble and unfit for service, from the
hardships they had undergone: in the same way he had
lost the majority of his horses, and made the rest useless from
the length and difficult nature of the journey. They had, therefore,
only to show themselves to the enemy.&#8221; But, above all,
he pointed out that &#8220;his own presence at their head ought to
be special encouragement to them: for that he would not have
left his fleet and Spanish campaign, on which he had been sent,
and have come to them in such haste, if he had not seen on
consideration that his doing so was necessary for his country&#8217;s
safety, and that a certain victory was secured to him by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The weight and influence of the speaker, as well as their
belief in his words, roused great enthusiasm among the men;
which Scipio acknowledged, and then dismissed them with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
additional injunction that they should hold themselves in readiness
to obey any order sent round to them.</p>

<p><a name="b3_65" id="b3_65"><b>65.</b></a> Next day both generals led their troops along the river
Padus, on the bank nearest the Alps, <span class="sidenote">Skirmish of
cavalry near the
Ticinus, Nov.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219.</span>
the Romans
having the stream on their left, the Carthaginians
on their right; and having ascertained on
the second day, by means of scouts, that they
were near each other, they both halted and remained encamped
for that day: but on the next, both taking their cavalry, and
Publius his sharp-shooters also, they hurried across the plain
to reconnoitre each other&#8217;s forces. As soon as they came
within distance, and saw the dust rising from the side of their
opponents, they drew up their lines for battle at once. Publius
put his sharp-shooters and Gallic horsemen in front, and
bringing the others into line, advanced at a slow pace.
Hannibal placed his cavalry that rode with bridles, and was
most to be depended on, in his front, and led them straight
against the enemy; having put the Numidian cavalry on either
wing to take the enemy on the flanks. The two generals and
the cavalry were in such hot haste to engage, that they closed
with each other before the sharp-shooters had an opportunity
of discharging their javelines at all. Before they could do so,
they left their ground, and retreated to the rear of their own
cavalry, making their way between the squadrons, terrified at
the approaching charge, and afraid of being trampled to death
by the horses which were galloping down upon them. The
cavalry charged each other front to front, and for a long time
maintained an equal contest; and a great many men dismounting
on the actual field, there was a mixed fight of horse and
foot. The Numidian horse, however, having outflanked the
Romans, charged them on the rear: and so the sharp-shooters,
who had fled from the cavalry charge at the beginning,
were now trampled to death by the numbers and furious
onslaught of the Numidians; while the front ranks originally
engaged with the Carthaginians, after losing many of
their men and inflicting a still greater loss on the enemy,
finding themselves charged on the rear by the Numidians,
broke into flight: most of them scattering in every direction,
while some of them kept closely massed round the Consul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b3_66" id="b3_66"><b>66.</b></a> Publius then broke up his camp, and marched through the
plains to the bridge over the Padus, in haste to get <span class="sidenote">Scipio retires to
Placentia on the
right bank of

his legions across before the enemy came up. He
saw that the level country where he was then was
favourable to the enemy with his superiority in
cavalry. He was himself disabled by a wound;<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> and he
decided that it was necessary to shift his quarters to a place of
safety. For a time Hannibal imagined that Scipio would give
him battle with his infantry also: but when he saw that he had
abandoned his camp, he went in pursuit of him as far as the
bridge over the Ticinus; but finding that the <span class="sidenote">Hannibal crosses
the Po higher up
and follows
Scipio to Placentia.</span>
greater part of the timbers of this bridge had been
torn away, while the men who guarded the bridge
were left still on his side of the river, he took
them prisoners to the number of about six hundred,
and being informed that the main army was far on its
way, he wheeled round and again ascended the Padus in search
of a spot in it which admitted of being easily bridged. After
two days&#8217; march he halted and constructed a bridge over the
river by means of boats. He committed the task of bringing
over the army to Hasdrubal;<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> while he himself crossed at once,
and busied himself in receiving the ambassadors who arrived
from the neighbouring districts. For no sooner had he
gained the advantage in the cavalry engagement, than all the
Celts in the vicinity hastened to fulfil their original engagement
by avowing themselves his friends, supplying him with
provisions, and joining the Carthaginian forces. After giving
these men a cordial reception, and getting his own army across
the Padus, he began to march back again down stream, with an
earnest desire of giving the enemy battle. Publius, too, had
crossed the river and was now encamped under the walls of the
Roman colony Placentia. There he made no sign of any
intention to move; for he was engaged in trying to heal his own
wound and those of his men, and considered that he had a
secure base of operations where he was. A two days&#8217; march
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>from the place where he had crossed the Padus brought
Hannibal to the neighbourhood of the enemy; and on the
third day he drew out his army for battle in full view of his
opponents: but as no one came out to attack, he pitched his
camp about fifty stades from them.</p>

<p><a name="b3_67" id="b3_67"><b>67.</b></a> But the Celtic contingent of the Roman army, seeing
that Hannibal&#8217;s prospects looked the brighter of
the two, <span class="sidenote">Treachery of the
Gauls serving in
the army of
Scipio.</span>
concerted their plans for a fixed time,
and waited in their several tents for the moment
of carrying them out. When the men within the
rampart of the camp had taken their supper and were gone to
bed, the Celts let more than half the night pass, and just about
the time of the morning watch armed themselves and fell upon
the Romans who were quartered nearest to them; killed a
considerable number, and wounded not a few; and, finally,
cutting off the heads of the slain, departed with them to join
the Carthaginians, to the number of two thousand infantry and
nearly two hundred cavalry. They were received with great satisfaction
by Hannibal; who, after addressing them encouragingly,
and promising them all suitable rewards, sent them to their
several cities, to declare to their compatriots what they had done,
and to urge them to make alliance with him: for he knew that
they would now all feel compelled to take part with him, when
they learnt the treachery of which their fellow-countrymen had
been guilty to the Romans. Just at the same time the Boii
came in, and handed over to him the three Agrarian Commissioners,
sent from Rome to divide the lands; whom, as I have
already related, they had seized by a sudden act of treachery
at the beginning of the war. Hannibal gratefully acknowledged
their good intention, and made a formal alliance with those
who came: but he handed them back their prisoners, bidding
them keep them safe, in order to get back their own hostages
from Rome, as they intended at first.</p>

<p>Publius regarded this treachery as of most serious importance;
and feeling sure that the Celts in the <span class="sidenote">Scipio changes
his position at
Placentia to one
on the Trebia.</span>
neighbourhood had long been ill-disposed, and
would, after this event, all incline to the Carthaginians,
he made up his mind that some precaution
for the future was necessary. The next night, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
just before the morning watch, he broke up his camp and
marched for the river Trebia, and the high ground near it,
feeling confidence in the protection which the strength of the
position and the neighbourhood of his allies would give him.</p>

<p><a name="b3_68" id="b3_68"><b>68.</b></a> When Hannibal was informed of Scipio&#8217;s change of
quarters, he sent the Numidian horse in pursuit
at once, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal follows
him.</span>
and the rest soon afterwards, following
close behind with his main army. The Numidians,
finding the Roman camp empty, stopped to set fire to it:
which proved of great service to the Romans; for if they had
pushed on and caught up the Roman baggage, a large number
of the rear-guard would have certainly been killed by the
cavalry in the open plains. But as it was, the greater part of
them got across the River Trebia in time; while those who
were after all too far in the rear to escape, were either killed or
made prisoners by the Carthaginians.</p>

<p>Scipio, however, having crossed the Trebia occupied the
first high ground; and having strengthened <span class="sidenote">Scipio&#8217;s position
on the slopes of
Apennines, near
the source of
the Trebia.</span>
his
camp with trench and palisade, waited the
arrival of his colleague, Tiberius Sempronius,
and his army; and was taking the greatest pains
to cure his wound, because he was exceedingly
anxious to take part in the coming engagement. Hannibal
pitched his camp about forty stades from him. While the
numerous Celts inhabiting the plains, excited by the good
prospects of the Carthaginians, supplied his army with provisions
in great abundance, and were eager to take their share with
Hannibal in every military operation or battle.</p>

<p>When news of the cavalry engagement reached Rome, the
disappointment of their confident expectations caused a feeling
of consternation in the minds of the people. Not but that
plenty of pretexts were found to prove to their own satisfaction
that the affair was not a defeat. Some laid the blame on the
Consul&#8217;s rashness, and others on the treacherous lukewarmness
of the Celts, which they concluded from their recent revolt
must have been shown by them on the field. But, after all,
as the infantry was still unimpaired, they made up their minds
that the general result was still as hopeful as ever. Accordingly,
when Tiberius and his legions arrived at Rome, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
marched through the city, they believed that his mere appearance
at the seat of war would settle the matter.</p>

<p>His men met Tiberius at Ariminum, according to their
oath, and he at once led them forward in all <span class="sidenote">Tiberius Sempronius
joins
Scipio.</span>
haste to join Publius Scipio. The junction
effected, and a camp pitched by the side of his
colleague, he was naturally obliged to refresh his men after
their forty days&#8217; continuous march between Ariminum and
Lilybaeum: but he went on with all preparations for a battle;
and was continually in conference with Scipio, asking questions
as to what had happened in the past, and discussing with him
the measures to be taken in the present.</p>

<p><a name="b3_69" id="b3_69"><b>69.</b></a> Meanwhile Hannibal got possession of Clastidium, by
the treachery of a certain Brundisian, <span class="sidenote">Fall of Clastidium.
Hannibal&#8217;s policy
towards the
Italians.</span>
to whom
it had been entrusted by the Romans. Having
become master of the garrison and the stores of
corn he used the latter for his present needs;
but took the men whom he had captured with him, without
doing them any harm, being desirous of showing by an example
the policy he meant to pursue; that those whose present
position towards Rome was merely the result of circumstances
should not be terrified, and give up hope of being spared by
him. The man who betrayed Clastidium to him he treated
with extraordinary honour, by way of tempting all men in
similar situations of authority to share the prospects of the
Carthaginians. But afterwards, finding that certain Celts who
lived in the fork of the Padus and the Trebia, while pretending
to have made terms with him, were sending messages to the
Romans at the same time, believing that they would thus
secure themselves from being harmed by either side, he sent
two thousand infantry with some Celtic and Numidian cavalry
with orders to devastate their territory. This order being
executed, and a great booty obtained, the Celts appeared at the
Roman camp beseeching their aid. Tiberius had been all
along looking out for an opportunity of striking a blow: <span class="sidenote">A skirmish
favourable to
the Romans.</span>
and
once seized on this pretext for sending out
a party, consisting of the greater part of his
cavalry; and a thousand sharp-shooters of his
infantry along with them; who having speedily come up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
with the enemy on the other side of the Trebia, and engaged
them in a sharp struggle for the possession of the booty,
forced the Celts and Numidians to beat a retreat to their own
camp. Those who were on duty in front of the Carthaginian
camp quickly perceived what was going on, and brought some
reserves to support the retreating cavalry; then the Romans
in their turn were routed, and had to retreat to their camp.
At this Tiberius sent out all his cavalry and sharp-shooters;
whereupon the Celts again gave way, and sought the protection
of their own camp. The Carthaginian general being unprepared
for a general engagement, and thinking it a sound
rule not to enter upon one on every casual opportunity, or
except in accordance with a settled design, acted, it must be
confessed, on this occasion with admirable generalship. He
checked their flight when his men were near the camp, and
forced them to halt and face about; but he sent out his
aides and buglers to recall the rest, and prevented them from
pursuing and engaging the enemy any more. So the Romans
after a short halt went back, having killed a large number of
the enemy, and lost very few themselves.</p>

<p><a name="b3_70" id="b3_70"><b>70.</b></a> Excited and overjoyed at this success Tiberius was
all eagerness for a general engagement. Now, it was in his
power to administer the war for the present as he chose, <span class="sidenote">Sempronius
resolves to give
battle.</span>
owing to the ill-health of Publius Scipio;
yet wishing to have his colleague&#8217;s opinion
in support of his own, he consulted him on
this subject. Publius however took quite an opposite view
of the situation. He thought his legions would be all the
better for a winter under arms; and that the fidelity of the
fickle Celts would never stand the test of want of success
and enforced inactivity on the part of the Carthaginians: they
would be certain, he thought, to turn against them once more.
Besides, when he had recovered from his wound, he hoped to
be able to do good service to his country himself. With these
arguments he tried to dissuade Tiberius from his design. The
latter felt that every one of these arguments were true and
sound; but, urged on by ambition and a blind confidence in
his fortune, he was eager to have the credit of the decisive
action to himself, before Scipio should be able to be present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
at the battle, or the next Consuls arrive to take over the
command; for the time for that to take place was now
approaching. As therefore he selected the time for the engagement
from personal considerations, rather than with a view
to the actual circumstances of the case, he was bound to make
a signal failure.</p>

<p>Hannibal took much the same view of the case as Scipio,
and was therefore, unlike him, eager for a battle; because, in
the first place, he wished to avail himself of the enthusiasm of
the Celts before it had at all gone off: in the second place, he
wished to engage the Roman legions while the soldiers in
them were raw recruits without practice in war: and, in
the third place, because he wished to fight the battle while
Scipio was still unfit for service: but most of all because he
wanted to be doing something and not to let the time slip by
fruitlessly; for when a general leads his troops into a foreign
country, and attempts what looks like a desperate undertaking,
the one chance for him is to keep the hopes of his allies alive
by continually striking some fresh blow.</p>

<p>Such were Hannibal&#8217;s feelings when he knew of the
intended attack of Tiberius.</p>

<p><a name="b3_71" id="b3_71"><b>71.</b></a> Now he had some time before remarked a certain
piece of ground which was flat and treeless, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal prepares
an ambuscade.</span>
and yet well suited for an ambush, because
there was a stream in it with a high overhanging
bank thickly covered with thorns and brambles.
Here he determined to entrap the enemy. The place was
admirably adapted for putting them off their guard; because
the Romans were always suspicious of woods, from the fact
of the Celts invariably choosing such places for their ambuscades,
but felt no fear at all of places that were level and without
trees: not knowing that for the concealment and safety of an
ambush such places are much better than woods; because
the men can command from them a distant view of all that
is going on: while nearly all places have sufficient cover to
make concealment possible,&mdash;a stream with an overhanging
bank, reeds, or ferns, or some sort of bramble-bushes,&mdash;which
are good enough to hide not infantry only, but sometimes even
cavalry, if the simple precaution is taken of laying conspicuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
arms flat upon the ground and hiding helmets under shields.
Hannibal had confided his idea to his brother Mago and to his
council, who had all approved of the plan. Accordingly, when
the army had supped, he summoned this young man to his
tent, who was full of youthful enthusiasm, and had been
trained from boyhood in the art of war, and put under his
command a hundred cavalry and the same number of infantry.
These men he had himself earlier in the day selected as the
most powerful of the whole army, and had ordered to come to
his tent after supper. Having addressed and inspired them
with the spirit suitable to the occasion, he bade each of them
select ten of the bravest men of their own company, and to
come with them to a particular spot in the camp. The order
having been obeyed, he despatched the whole party, numbering
a thousand cavalry and as many infantry, with guides, to the
place selected for the ambuscade; and gave his brother
directions as to the time at which he was to make the attempt.
At daybreak he himself mustered the Numidian cavalry, who
were conspicuous for their powers of endurance; and after
addressing them, and promising them rewards if they behaved
with gallantry, he ordered them to ride up to the enemy&#8217;s lines,
and then quickly cross the river, and by throwing showers of
darts at them tempt them to come out: his object being to
get at the enemy before they had had their breakfast, or made
any preparations for the day. The other officers of the army
also he summoned, and gave them similar instructions for the
battle, ordering all their men to get breakfast and to see to
their arms and horses.</p>

<p><a name="b3_72" id="b3_72"><b>72.</b></a> As soon as Tiberius saw the Numidian horse approaching,
he immediately sent out his cavalry by itself <span class="sidenote">Battle of the
Trebia,
December <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
218.</span>
with orders to engage the enemy, and keep them
in play, while he despatched after them six
thousand foot armed with javelins, and got the
rest of the army in motion, with the idea that their appearance
would decide the affair: for his superiority in numbers, and
his success in the cavalry skirmish of the day before, had filled
him with confidence. But it was now mid-winter and the day
was snowy and excessively cold, and men and horses were
marching out almost entirely without having tasted food; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
accordingly, though the troops were at first in high spirits, yet
when they had crossed the Trebia, swollen by the floods which
the rain of the previous night had brought down from the high
ground above the camp, wading breast deep through the
stream, they were in a wretched state from the cold and want
of food as the day wore on. While the Carthaginians
on the contrary had eaten and <span class="sidenote">Hannibal&#8217;s forces.</span>
drunk in their tents, and got their horses ready, and were all
anointing and arming themselves round the fires. Hannibal
waited for the right moment to strike, and as soon as he saw
that the Romans had crossed the Trebia, throwing out eight
thousand spearmen and slingers to cover his advance, he led out
his whole army. When he had advanced about eight stades from
the camp, he drew up his infantry, consisting of about twenty
thousand Iberians, Celts, and Libyans, in one long line, while
he divided his cavalry and placed half on each wing, amounting
in all to more than ten thousand, counting the Celtic allies;
his elephants also he divided between the two wings, where they
occupied the front rank. Meanwhile Tiberius <span class="sidenote">The Roman
forces.</span>
had recalled his cavalry because he saw that they
could do nothing with the enemy. For the
Numidians when attacked retreated without difficulty, scattering
in every direction, and then faced about again and charged,
which is the peculiar feature of their mode of warfare. But
he drew up his infantry in the regular Roman order, consisting
of sixteen thousand citizens and twenty thousand allies; for
that is the complete number of a Roman army in an important
campaign, when the two Consuls are compelled by
circumstances to combine forces.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> He then placed the cavalry
on either wing, numbering four thousand, and advanced against
the enemy in gallant style, in regular order, and at a deliberate
pace.</p>

<p><a name="b3_73" id="b3_73"><b>73.</b></a> When the two forces came within distance, the light-armed
troops in front of the two armies <span class="sidenote">The Roman
cavalry retreat.</span>
closed with each other. In this part of the
battle the Romans were in many respects
at a disadvantage, while the Carthaginians had everything in
their favour. For the Roman spearmen had been on hard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>service ever since daybreak, and had expended most of their
weapons in the engagement with the Numidians, while those
weapons which were left had become useless from being long
wet. Nor were the cavalry, or indeed the whole army, any
better off in these respects. The case of the Carthaginians
was exactly the reverse: they had come on the field perfectly
sound and fresh, and were ready and eager for every service
required of them. As soon, therefore, as their advanced guard
had retired again within their lines, and the heavy-armed soldiers
were engaged, the cavalry on the two wings of the Carthaginian
army at once charged the enemy with all the effect of
superiority in numbers, and in the condition both of men
and horses secured by their freshness when they started. The
Roman cavalry on the contrary retreated: and the flanks of
the line being thus left unprotected, the Carthaginian spearmen
and the main body of the Numidians, passing their own
advanced guard, charged the Roman flanks: and, by the
damage which they did them, prevented them from keeping
up the fight with the troops on their front. The heavy-armed
soldiers, however, who were in the front rank of both armies,
and in the centre of that, maintained an obstinate and equal
fight for a considerable time.</p>

<p><a name="b3_74" id="b3_74"><b>74.</b></a> Just then the Numidians, who had been lying in
ambush, left their hiding-place, <span class="sidenote">Both Roman
wings defeated.</span>and by a
sudden charge on the centre of the Roman
rear produced great confusion and alarm
throughout the army. Finally both the Roman wings, being
hard pressed in front by the elephants, and on both flanks by
the light-armed troops of the enemy, gave way, and in their
flight were forced upon the river behind them. After this,
while the centre of the Roman rear was losing heavily, and
suffering severely from the attack of the Numidian ambuscade,
their front, thus driven to bay, defeated the Celts and a division
of Africans, and, after killing a large number of them, succeeded
in cutting their way through the Carthaginian line. Then
seeing that their wings had been forced off their ground, they
gave up all hope of relieving them or getting back to their
camp, partly because of the number of the enemy&#8217;s cavalry,
and partly because they were hindered by the river and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
pelting storm of rain which was pouring down upon their
heads. They therefore closed their ranks, <span class="sidenote">The Roman centre
fights its way to
Placentia.</span>
and made their way safely to Placentia,
to the number of ten thousand. Of the
rest of the army the greater number were killed by the
elephants and cavalry on the bank of the Trebia; while those
of the infantry who escaped, and the greater part of the cavalry,
managed to rejoin the ten thousand mentioned above, and
arrived with them at Placentia. Meanwhile the Carthaginian
army pursued the enemy as far as the Trebia; but being prevented
by the storm from going farther, returned to their camp.
They regarded the result of the battle with great exultation, as
a complete success; for the loss of the Iberians and Africans
had been light, the heaviest having fallen on the Celts. But
from the rain and the snow which followed it, they suffered
so severely, that all the elephants except one died, and a large
number of men and horses perished from the cold.</p>

<p><a name="b3_75" id="b3_75"><b>75.</b></a> Fully aware of the nature of his disaster, but wishing
to conceal its extent as well as he could from the people at
home, Tiberius sent messengers to announce that a battle had
taken place, but that the storm had deprived them of the
victory. For the moment this news was believed at Rome;
but when soon afterwards it became known that the Carthaginians
were in possession of the Roman camp, and that all the
Celts had joined them: while their own troops had abandoned
their camp, and, after retiring from the field of battle, were all
collected in the neighbouring cities; and were besides being
supplied with necessary provisions by sea up the Padus, the
Roman people became only too certain of what had really
happened in the battle. <span class="sidenote">Winter of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
118-117.
Great exertions
at Rome to meet
the danger.</span>
It was a most unexpected
reverse, and it forced them at once
to urge on with energy the remaining preparations
for the war. They reinforced those
positions which lay in the way of the enemy&#8217;s
advance; sent legions to Sardinia and Sicily, as well as
garrisons to Tarentum, and other places of strategical importance;
and, moreover, fitted out a fleet of sixty quinqueremes.
The Consuls designate, Gnaeus Servilius and
Gaius Flaminius, were collecting the allies and enrolling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
citizen legions, and sending supplies to Ariminum and Etruria,
with a view of going to the seat of war by those two routes.
They sent also to king Hiero asking for reinforcements, who
sent them five hundred Cretan archers and a thousand
peltasts. In fact they pushed on their preparations in every
direction with energy. For the Roman people are most
formidable, collectively and individually, when they have real
reason for alarm.</p>

<p><a name="b3_76" id="b3_76"><b>76.</b></a> While these events were happening in Italy, Gnaeus
Cornelius Scipio, who had been left by his <span class="sidenote">Gnaeus Scipio
in Spain.</span>
brother Publius in command of the fleet, setting
sail from the mouth of the Rhone, came to
land with his whole squadron at a place in Iberia called
Emporium. Starting from this town, he made descents
upon the coast, landing and besieging those who refused
to submit to him along the seaboard as far as the
Iber; and treating with every mark of kindness those who
acceded to his demands, and taking all the precautions
he could for their safety. When he had garrisoned those
towns on the coast that submitted, he led his whole army
inland, having by this time a not inconsiderable contingent of
Iberian allies; and took possession of the towns on his line of
march, some by negotiation and some by force of arms. The
Carthaginian troops which Hannibal had left in that district
under the command of Hanno, lay entrenched to resist him
under the walls of a town called Cissa.</p>

<p>Defeating this army in a pitched battle, Gnaeus not only
got possession of a rich booty, for the whole baggage of the
army invading Italy had been left under its charge, but secured
the friendly alliance of all the Iberian tribes north of the Iber,
and took both Hanno, the general of the Carthaginians, and
Andobales, the general of the Iberians, prisoners. The latter
was despot of central Iberia, and had always been especially
inclined to the side of Carthage.</p>

<p>Immediately he learnt what had happened, Hasdrubal
crossed the Iber to bring aid. There he ascertained that the
Roman troops left in charge of the fleet had abandoned all
precautions, and were trading on the success of the land forces
to pass their time in ease. He therefore took with him eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
thousand infantry and one thousand cavalry of his own army,
and finding the men of the fleet scattered about the country,
he killed a great many of them and forced the rest to fly for
refuge to their ships. He then retired across the Iber again,
and employed himself in fortifying and garrisoning the posts
south of the river, taking up his winter quarters at New
Carthage. When Gnaeus rejoined his fleet, he punished the
authors of the disaster according to the Roman custom; and
then collected his land and sea forces together in Tarraco, and
there took up his winter quarters; and by dividing the booty
equally between his soldiers, inspired them at once with
affection towards himself and eagerness for future service.
Such was the course of the Iberian campaign.</p>

<p><a name="b3_77" id="b3_77"><b>77.</b></a> At the beginning of the following spring, Gaius Flaminius
marched his army through Etruria, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>and
pitched his camp at Arretium; while his colleague
Gnaeus Servilius on the other hand went to Ariminum,
to await the advance of the enemy in that direction.</p>

<p>Passing the winter in the Celtic territory, Hannibal kept
his Roman prisoners in close confinement, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal conciliates
the
Italians.</span>
supplying them very sparingly with food;
while he treated their allies with great
kindness from the first, and finally called them together and
addressed them, alleging, &#8220;that he had not come to fight
against them, but against Rome in their behalf; and that,
therefore, if they were wise, they would attach themselves to
him: because he had come to restore freedom to the Italians,
and to assist them to recover their cities and territory which
they had severally lost to Rome.&#8221; With these words he
dismissed them without ransom to their own homes: wishing
by this policy to attract the inhabitants of Italy to his cause,
and to alienate their affections from Rome, and to awaken the
resentment of all those who considered themselves to have suffered
by the loss of harbours or cities under the Roman rule.</p>

<p><a name="b3_78" id="b3_78"><b>78.</b></a> While he was in these winter quarters also he practised
a ruse truly Punic. Being apprehensive that from the fickleness
of their character, and the newness of the tie between
himself and them, the Celts might lay plots against his life, he
caused a number of wigs to be made for him, suited in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
appearance to men of various ages; and these he constantly
varied, changing at the same time his clothes also to
harmonise with the particular wig which he wore. He thus
made it hard to recognise him, not only for those who
met him suddenly, but even for his intimates. But seeing that
the Celts were discontented at the lengthened continuance of
the war within their borders, and were in a state of restless hurry
to invade the enemy&#8217;s territory,&mdash;on the pretence of hatred for
Rome, but in reality from love of booty,&mdash;he determined to
break up his camp as soon as possible, and satisfy the desires
of his army. Accordingly as soon as the change of season set
in, by questioning those who were reputed to know the
country best, he ascertained that the other roads leading into
Etruria were long and well known to the enemy, but that the one
which led through the marshes was short, and would bring
them upon Flaminius as a surprise.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> This was what suited his
peculiar genius, and he therefore decided to take this route.
But when the report was spread in his army that the general
was going to lead them through some marshes, every soldier
felt alarmed at the idea of the quagmires and deep sloughs
which they would find on this march.</p>

<p><a name="b3_79" id="b3_79"><b>79.</b></a> But after a careful inquiry as to what part of the road
was firm or boggy, Hannibal broke up his camp
and marched out. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal starts

and the baggage within their lines, that there
might be plenty of provisions for their immediate needs.
Provisions for the future he entirely neglected. Because
he calculated that on reaching the enemy&#8217;s territory, if he were
beaten he should not require them, and if he were victorious he
would find abundance in the open country. Behind this
vanguard he placed the Celts, and in the rear of all the
cavalry. He entrusted the command of the rear-guard to his
brother Mago, that he might see to the security of all, and
especially to guard against the cowardice and impatience of
hard labour which characterised the Celts; in order that, if the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>difficulty of the route should induce them to turn back, he
might intercept them by means of the cavalry and force them
to proceed. In point of fact, the Iberians and Libyans,
having great powers of endurance and being habituated to such
fatigues, and also because when they marched through them
the marshes<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> were fresh and untrodden, accomplished their
march with a moderate amount of distress: but the Celts
advanced with great difficulty, because the marshes were now
disturbed and trodden into a deep morass: and being quite
unaccustomed to such painful labours, they bore the fatigue
with anger and impatience; but were hindered from turning
back by the cavalry in their rear. All however suffered
grievously, especially from the impossibility of getting
sleep on a continuous march of four days and three nights
through a route which was under water: but none suffered
so much, or lost so many men, as the Celts. Most of his
beasts of burden also slipping in the mud fell and perished,
and could then only do the men one service: they sat upon
their dead bodies, and piling up baggage upon them so as to
stand out above the water, they managed to get a snatch of
sleep<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> for a short portion of the night. Another misfortune
was that a considerable number of the horses lost their hoofs
by the prolonged march through bog. Hannibal himself was
with difficulty and much suffering got across riding on the only
elephant left alive, enduring great agony from a severe attack
of ophthalmia, by which he eventually lost the sight of one
eye, because the time and the difficulties of the situation did
not admit of his waiting or applying any treatment to it.</p>

<p><a name="b3_80" id="b3_80"><b>80.</b></a> Having crossed the marshes in this unexpected
manner, Hannibal found Flaminius in Etruria
encamped under the walls of Arretium. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal in the
valley of the
Arno.</span>
For the
present he pitched his camp close to the marshes,
to refresh his army, and to investigate the plans of his enemies
and the lie of the country in his front. And being informed that
the country before him abounded in wealth, and that Flaminius
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>was a mere mob-orator and demagogue, with no ability for
the actual conduct of military affairs, and was moreover
unreasonably confident in his resources; he calculated that, if
he passed his camp and made a descent into the district
beyond, partly for fear of popular reproach and partly from a
personal feeling of irritation, Flaminius would be unable to
endure to watch passively the devastation of the country, and
would spontaneously follow him wherever he went; and being
eager to secure the credit of a victory for himself, without
waiting for the arrival of his colleague, would give him many
opportunities for an attack.</p>

<p><a name="b3_81" id="b3_81"><b>81.</b></a> And in making these calculations Hannibal showed his
consummate prudence and strategical ability. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal
correctly judges
the character of
Flaminius.</span>
For it is mere blind ignorance to believe that
there can be anything of more vital importance
to a general than the knowledge of his
opponent&#8217;s character and disposition. As in combats between
individuals or ranks, he who would conquer must observe
carefully how it is possible to attain his object, and what part
of his enemy appears unguarded or insufficiently armed,&mdash;so
must a commander of an army look out for the weak place,
not in the body, but in the mind of the leader of the hostile
force. For it has often happened before now that from mere
idleness and lack of energy, men have let not only the welfare
of the state, but even their private fortunes fall to ruin: some
are so addicted to wine that they cannot sleep without
bemusing their intellects with drink; and others so infatuated in
their pursuit of sensual pleasures, that they have not only been
the ruin of their cities and fortunes, but have forfeited life itself
with disgrace. In the case of individuals, however, cowardice
and sloth bring shame only on themselves; but when it is
a commander-in-chief that is concerned, the disaster affects all
alike and is of the most fatal consequence. It not only
infects the men under him with an inactivity like his own; but
it often brings absolute dangers of the most serious description
upon those who trust such a general. For rashness, temerity,
and uncalculating impetuosity, as well as foolish ambition and
vanity, give an easy victory to the enemy. And are the source
of numerous dangers to one&#8217;s friends: for a man who is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
prey of such weaknesses falls the easiest victim to every
stratagem, ambush or ruse. The general then who can gain
a clear idea of his opponent&#8217;s weaknesses, and direct his attack
on the point where he is most open to it, will very soon be
the victor in the campaign. For as a ship, if you deprive it
of its steerer, falls with all its crew into the hands of the
enemy; so, in the case of an army in war, if you outwit or
out-man&oelig;uvre its general, the whole will often fall into your
hands.</p>

<p><a name="b3_82" id="b3_82"><b>82.</b></a> Nor was Hannibal mistaken in his calculations in
regard to Flaminius. For no sooner had he <span class="sidenote">Flaminius is
drawn out of
camp.</span>
left the neighbourhood of Faesulae, and,
advancing a short way beyond the Roman
camp, made a raid upon the neighbouring country, than
Flaminius became excited, and enraged at the idea that he was
despised by the enemy: and as the devastation of the country
went on, and he saw from the smoke that rose in every
direction that the work of destruction was proceeding, he could
not patiently endure the sight. Some of his officers advised
that they should not follow the enemy at once nor engage
him, but should act on the defensive, in view of his great
superiority in cavalry; and especially that they should wait for
the other Consul, and not give battle until the two armies were
combined. But Flaminius, far from listening to their advice,
was indignant at those who offered it; and bade them consider
what the people at home would say at the country being laid
waste almost up to the walls of Rome itself, while they
remained encamped in Etruria on the enemy&#8217;s rear. Finally,
with these words, he set his army in motion, without any settled
plan of time or place; but bent only on falling in with the
enemy, as though certain victory awaited him. For he had
managed to inspire the people with such confident expectations,
that the unarmed citizens who followed his camp in hope of
booty, bringing chains and fetters and all such gear, were more
numerous than the soldiers themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hannibal was advancing on his way to Rome
through Etruria, keeping the city of Cortona and its hills on
his left, and the Thrasymene lake on his right; and as he
marched, he burned and wasted the country with a view of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
rousing the wrath of the enemy and tempting him to come out.
And when he saw Flaminius get well within distance, and
observed that the ground he then occupied was suited to his
purpose, he bent his whole energies on preparing for a general
engagement.</p>

<p><a name="b3_83" id="b3_83"><b>83.</b></a> The route which he was following led through a low
valley enclosed on both sides by long lines of
lofty hills. <span class="sidenote">The ambuscade
at Lake Thrasymene.</span>Of its two ends, that in front was
blocked by an abrupt and inaccessible hill, and
that on the rear by the lake, between which and the foot of
the cliff there is only a very narrow defile leading into this
valley.    Making his way to the end of the valley along the
bank of the lake, Hannibal posted himself with the Spanish
and Libyan troops on the hill immediately in front of him as
he marched, and pitched a camp on it; but sent his Balearic
slingers and light-armed troops by a d&eacute;tour, and stationed
them in extended order under the cover of the hills to the
right of the valley; and by a similar d&eacute;tour placed the Gauls
and cavalry under the cover of hills to the left, causing them
also to extend their line so far as to cover the entrance of the
defile running between the cliff and lake into the valley.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>Having made these preparations during the night, and
having thus enclosed the valley with ambuscades, Hannibal
remained quiet. In pursuit of him came Flaminius, in hot
haste to close with the enemy. It was late in the evening before
he pitched his camp on the border of the lake; and at daybreak
next morning, just before the morning watch, he led his front
maniples forward along the borders of the lake into the valley
with a view of engaging the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b3_84" id="b3_84"><b>84.</b></a> The day was exceedingly misty: and as soon as the
greater part of the Roman line was in the valley, <span class="sidenote">The battle,
22d June.</span>
and the leading maniples were getting close to
him, Hannibal gave the signal for attack; and at the same time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>sent orders to the troops lying in ambush on the hills to do
the same, and thus delivered an assault upon the enemy at
every point at once. Flaminius was taken completely by
surprise: the mist was so thick, and the enemy were charging
down from the upper ground at so many points at once, that
not only were the Centurions and Tribunes unable to relieve
any part of the line that was in difficulties, but were not even
able to get any clear idea of what was going on: for they were
attacked simultaneously on front, rear, and both flanks. The
result was that most of them were cut down in the order of
march, without being able to defend themselves: exactly as
though they had been actually given up to slaughter by
the folly of their leader. Flaminius himself, in a state
of the utmost distress and despair, was attacked and killed
by a company of Celts. As many as fifteen thousand
Romans fell in the valley, who could neither yield nor defend
themselves, being habituated to regard it as their supreme
duty not to fly or quit their ranks. But those who were
caught in the defile between the lake and the cliff perished in
a shameful, or rather a most miserable, manner: for being
thrust into the lake, some in their frantic terror endeavoured
to swim with their armour on, and presently sank and were
drowned; while the greater number, wading as far as they could
into the lake, remained there with their heads above water;
and when the cavalry rode in after them, and certain death
stared them in the face, they raised their hands and begged
for quarter, offering to surrender, and using every imaginary
appeal for mercy; but were finally despatched by the
enemy, or, in some cases, begged the favour of the fatal
blow from their friends, or inflicted it on themselves. A
number of men, however, amounting perhaps to six thousand,
who were in the valley, defeated the enemy immediately in
front of them; but though they might have done much to
retrieve the fortune of the day, they were unable to go to the
relief of their comrades, or get to the rear of their opponents,
because they could not see what was going on. They accordingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
pushed on continually to the front, always expecting to
find themselves engaged with some of the enemy: until they
discovered that, without noticing it, they were issuing upon
the higher ground. But when they were on the crest of
the hills, the mist broke and they saw clearly the disaster
which had befallen them; and being no longer able to do any
good, since the enemy was victorious all along the line, and in
complete possession of the ground, they closed their ranks and
made for a certain Etrurian village. After the battle Maharbal
was sent by Hannibal with the Iberians and light-armed troops
to besiege the village; and seeing themselves surrounded by a
complication of dangers, they laid down their arms and surrendered
on condition of their lives being spared. Such was
the end of the final engagement between the Romans and
Carthaginians in Etruria.</p>

<p><a name="b3_85" id="b3_85"><b>85.</b></a> When the prisoners who had surrendered on terms
were with the other prisoners brought to
Hannibal, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal&#8217;s
treatment of
prisoners.</span>
he had them all collected together
to the number of more than fifteen thousand,
and began by saying that Maharbal had no authority
to grant them their lives without consulting him. He then
launched out into an invective against Rome: and when he had
finished that, he distributed all the prisoners who were Romans
among the companies of his army to be held in safe keeping;
but allowed all the allies to depart without ransom to their own
country, with the same remark as he had made before, that
&#8220;he was not come to fight against Italians, but in behalf of
Italians against Rome.&#8221; He then gave his army time to refresh
themselves after their fatigue, and buried those of highest rank
who had fallen in his army, amounting to about thirty; the
total number of his loss being fifteen hundred, most of whom
were Celts. He then began considering, in conjunction with
his brother and friends, where and how he should continue his
attack, for he now felt confident of ultimate success.</p>

<p>When the news of this disaster reached Rome, the chief
men of the state could not, <span class="sidenote">Dismay at Rome.</span>in view of the
gravity of the blow, conceal its extent or
soften it down, but were forced to assemble the people
and tell them the truth. When the Praetor, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
from the Rostra said, &#8220;We have been beaten in a great
battle,&#8221; there was such a consternation, that those who had
been present at the battle as well as at this meeting, felt the
disaster to be graver than when they were on the field of
battle itself. And this feeling of the people was not to be
wondered at. For many years they had been unaccustomed
to the word or the fact of defeat, and they could not now
endure reverse with patience or dignity. The Senate, however,
rose to the occasion, and held protracted debates and consultations
as to the future, anxiously considering what it was
the duty of all classes to do, and how they were to do it.</p>

<p><a name="b3_86" id="b3_86"><b>86.</b></a> About the same time as the battle of Thrasymene,
the Consul Gnaeus Servilius, <span class="sidenote">Servilius&#8217;s
advanced guard
cut to pieces.</span>who had been
stationed on duty at Ariminum,&mdash;which
is on the coast of the Adriatic, where the
plains of Cis-Alpine Gaul join the rest of Italy, not far from
the mouths of the Padus,&mdash;having heard that Hannibal had
entered Etruria and was encamped near Flaminius, designed
to join the latter with his whole army. But finding himself
hampered by the difficulty of transporting so heavy a force, he
sent Gaius Centenius forward in haste with four thousand
horse, intending that he should be there before himself in case
of need. But Hannibal, getting early intelligence after the
battle of Thrasymene of this reinforcement of the enemy, sent
Maharbal with his light-armed troops, and a detachment of
cavalry, who falling in with Gaius, killed nearly half his men
at the first encounter; and having pursued the remainder to a
certain hill, on the very next day took them all prisoners.
The news of the battle of Thrasymene was three days&#8217; old at
Rome, and the sorrow caused by it was, so to speak, at its
hottest, when this further disaster was announced. The consternation
caused by it was no longer confined to the people.
The Senate now fully shared in it; and it was resolved that the
usual annual arrangements for the election of magistrates
should be suspended, and a more radical remedy be sought
for the present dangers; for they came to the conclusion that
their affairs were in such a state, as to require a commander
with absolute powers.</p>

<p>Feeling now entirely confident of success, Hannibal rejected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the idea of approaching Rome for the present; but traversed
the country plundering it without resistance, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal&#8217;s
advance after the
battle.</span>and
directing his march towards the coast of the
Adriatic. Having passed through Umbria and
Picenum, he came upon the coast after a ten days&#8217; march
with such enormous booty, that the army could neither
drive nor carry all the wealth which they had taken, and
after killing a large number of people on his road. For
the order was given, usual in the storming of cities, to kill
all adults who came in their way: an order which Hannibal was
prompted to give now by his deep-seated hatred of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p><a name="b3_87" id="b3_87"><b>87.</b></a> Pitching his camp on the shore of the Adriatic, in a
district extraordinarily rich in every kind of produce, he took
great pains to refresh his men and restore their health, and no
less so that of the horses. For the cold and squalor of a
winter spent in Gallia Cis-Alpina without the protection of a
roof, and then the painful march through the marshes, had
brought upon most of the horses, and the men as well, an
attack of scurvy and all its consequences. Having therefore
now got possession of a rich country, he got his horses into
condition again, and restored the bodies and spirits of his
soldiers; and made the Libyans change their own for Roman
arms selected for the purpose, which he could easily do from
being possessed of so many sets stripped from the bodies of the
enemy. He now sent messengers, too, to Carthage by sea, to
report what had taken place, for this was the first time he had
reached the sea since he entered Italy. The Carthaginians
were greatly rejoiced at the news: and took measures with
enthusiasm for forwarding supplies to their armies, both in
Iberia and Italy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Romans had appointed Quintus Fabius
Dictator,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> a man distinguished no less for his wisdom than his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
high birth; as is still commemorated by the fact that the
members of his family are even now called
<i>Maximi</i>, <span class="sidenote">Q. Fabius Maximus
Dictator.</span>
that is &#8220;Greatest,&#8221; in honour of his
successful achievements. A Dictator differs
from the Consuls in this, that each Consul is followed by twelve
lictors, the Dictator by twenty-four. Again, the Consuls have
frequently to refer to the Senate to enable them to carry out
their proposed plans, but the Dictator is absolute, and when
he is appointed all other magistrates in Rome are at once
deprived of power, except the Tribunes of the People.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> I shall,
however, take another opportunity of speaking in more detail
about these officers. With the Dictator they appointed Marcus
Minucius master of the horse; this is an officer under the
Dictator, and takes his place when engaged elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="b3_88" id="b3_88"><b>88.</b></a> Though Hannibal shifted his quarters from time to
time for short distances in one direction or another, he remained
in the neighbourhood of the Adriatic; and by bathing his
horses with old wine, of which he had a great store, cured
them of the scab and got them into condition again. By a
similar treatment he cured his men of their wounds, and got
the others into a sound state of health and spirits for the
service before them. After traversing with fire and sword
the territories of Praetutia,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> Hadriana, Marrucina, and Frentana,
he started on his road to Iapygia. This district is divided
among three peoples, each with a district name, Daunii, Peucetii,
and Messapii. Hannibal first invaded the territory of the
Daunii, beginning from Luceria, a Roman colony, and laid the
country waste. He next encamped near Vibo, and overran the
territory of Arpi, and plundered all Daunia without resistance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fabius, after offering the usual sacrifice to the
gods upon his appointment, started with his <span class="sidenote">Fabius takes the
command.</span>
master of the horse and four legions which
had been enrolled for the purpose; and
having effected a junction near Daunia with the troops that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>had come to the rescue from Ariminum, he relieved Gnaeus
of his command on shore and sent him with an escort to
Rome, with orders to be ready with help for any emergency,
in case the Carthaginians made any movement by sea. Fabius
himself, with his master of the horse, took over the command of
the whole army and pitched his camp opposite the Carthaginians,
near a place called Aecae,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> about six miles from the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b3_89" id="b3_89"><b>89.</b></a> When Hannibal learnt that Fabius had arrived, he
determined to terrify the enemy by promptly attacking. <span class="sidenote">Cunctator.</span>He
therefore led out his army, approached the
Roman camp, and there drew up his men
in order of battle; but when he had waited some time,
and nobody came out to attack him, he drew off and
retired to his own camp. For Fabius, having made up
his mind to incur no danger and not to risk a battle, but to
make the safety of his men his first and greatest object, kept
resolutely to this purpose. At first he was despised for it, and
gave rise to scandalous insinuations that he was an utter
coward and dared not face an engagement: but in course of
time he compelled everybody to confess and allow that it was
impossible for any one to have acted, in the existing circumstances,
with greater discretion and prudence. And it was not
long before facts testified to the wisdom of his policy. Nor
was it wonderful that it was so. For the forces of his
opponents had been trained from their earliest youth without
intermission in war; had a general who had grown up with
them and from childhood had been instructed in the arts of
the camp; had won many battles in Iberia, and twice running
had beaten the Romans and their allies: and, what was more
than all, had thoroughly made up their minds that their one
hope of safety was in victory. In every respect the circumstances
of the Roman army were the exact opposite of these;
and therefore, their manifest inferiority making it impossible
for Fabius to offer the enemy battle, he fell back upon those
resources in which the Romans had the advantage of the
enemy; clung to them; and conducted the war by their means:
and they were&mdash;an inexhaustible supply of provisions and of
men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b3_90" id="b3_90"><b>90.</b></a> He, then, during the following months, kept his army
continually hovering in the neighbourhood of the enemy, his
superior knowledge of the country enabling him to occupy
beforehand all the posts of vantage; and having supplies in
abundance on his rear, he never allowed his soldiers to go on
foraging expeditions, or get separated, on any pretence, from the
camp; but keeping them continually massed together and in
close union, he watched for favourable opportunities of time
and place; and by this method of proceeding captured and
killed a large number of the enemy, who in their contempt of
him straggled from their camp in search of plunder. His
object in these man&oelig;uvres was twofold,&mdash;to gradually diminish
the limited numbers of the enemy: and to strengthen and renew
by such successes in detail the spirits of his own men,
which had been depressed, to begin with, by the general defeat
of their armies. But nothing would induce him to agree to
give his enemy a set battle. <span class="sidenote">Minucius
discontented.</span>
This policy however
was by no means approved of by his master
of the horse, Marcus. He joined in the general
verdict, and decried Fabius in every one&#8217;s hearing, as conducting
his command in a cowardly and unenterprising spirit; and
was himself eager to venture upon a decisive engagement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Carthaginians, after wasting these districts,
crossed the Apennines; and descending upon
Samnium, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal in
Samnium and
Apulia.</span>
which was rich and had been free
from war for many years past, found themselves
in possession of such an abundance of provisions, that
they could get rid of them neither by use nor waste. They
overran also the territory of Beneventum, which was a Roman
colony; and took the town of Venusia, which was unwalled
and richly furnished with every kind of property. All
this time the Romans were following on his rear, keeping
one or two days&#8217; march behind him, but never venturing to
approach or engage the enemy. Accordingly, when Hannibal
saw that Fabius plainly meant to decline a battle, but yet would
not abandon the country altogether, he formed the bold resolution
of penetrating to the plains round Capua; and actually
did so as far as Falernum, convinced that thereby he should
do one of two things,&mdash;force the enemy to give him battle, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
make it evident to all that the victory was his, and that the
Romans had abandoned the country to him. This he hoped
would strike terror into the various cities, and cause them to
be eager to revolt from Rome. For up to that time, though
the Romans had been beaten in two battles, not a single city
in Italy had revolted to the Carthaginians; but all maintained
their fidelity, although some of them were suffering severely;&mdash;a
fact which may show us the awe and respect which the
Republic had inspired in its allies.</p>

<p><a name="b3_91" id="b3_91"><b>91.</b></a> Hannibal, however, had not adopted this plan without
good reason. For the plains about Capua are the best in
Italy for fertility and beauty and proximity to the sea, and for
the commercial harbours, into which merchants run who are
sailing to Italy from nearly all parts of the world. They contain,
moreover, the most famous and beautiful cities of Italy.
On its seaboard are Sinuessa, Cumae, Puteoli, Naples, and
Nuceria; and inland to the north there are Cales and Teanum,
to the east and south [Caudium<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>] and Nola. In the centre
of these plains lies the richest of all the cities, that of Capua.
No tale in all mythology wears a greater appearance of probability
than that which is told of these, which, like others
remarkable for their beauty, are called the Phlegraean plains;
for surely none are more likely for beauty and fertility to have
been contended for by gods. In addition to these advantages,
they are strongly protected by nature and difficult of approach;
for one side is protected by the sea, and the rest by a long
and high chain of mountains, through which there are but
three passes from the interior, narrow and difficult, one from
Samnium [a second from Latium<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>] and a third from Hirpini.
So that if the Carthaginians succeeded in fixing their quarters
in these plains, they would have the advantage of a kind
of theatre, in which to display the terrors of their power before
the gaze of all Italy; and would make a spectacle also of the
cowardice of their enemies in shrinking from giving them
battle, while they themselves would be proved beyond dispute
to be masters of the country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b3_92" id="b3_92"><b>92.</b></a> With this view Hannibal crossed from Samnium by
the pass of the hill called Eribianus,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> and
encamped on the bank of the river Vulturnus, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal
descends into the
Falernian plain.</span>
which almost divides these plains in half.
His camp was on the side of the river towards Rome, but
he overran the whole plain with foraging parties. Though
utterly aghast at the audacity of the enemy&#8217;s proceedings,
Fabius stuck all the more firmly to the policy upon which he
had determined. But his colleague Minucius, and all the
centurions and tribunes of the army, thinking that they had
caught the enemy in an excellent trap, were of opinion that
they should make all haste into the plains, and not allow the
most splendid part of the country to be devastated. Until
they reached the spot, Fabius hurried on, and feigned to share
their eager and adventurous spirit; and, when he was near the
ager Falernus, he showed himself on the mountain skirts and
kept in a line with the enemy, that he might not be thought by
the allies to abandon the country: but he would not let his army
descend into the plain, being still unwilling to risk a general
engagement, partly for the same reasons as before, and partly
because the enemy were conspicuously superior in cavalry.</p>

<p>After trying to provoke his enemies, and collecting an
unlimited amount of booty by laying waste
the whole plain, <span class="sidenote">Fabius lies in wait.</span>Hannibal began taking
measures for removing: wishing not to waste his booty,
but to stow it in some safe place, which he might
also make his winter quarters; that the army might not
only be well off for the present, but might have abundant
supplies all through the winter. Fabius, learning that he
meditated returning the same way as he came, and seeing that
the pass was a narrow one, and extremely well suited for an
attack by ambush, placed about four thousand men at the exact
spot that he would have to pass; while he, with the main body
of his troops, encamped on a hill which commanded the
entrance of the pass.</p>

<p><a name="b3_93" id="b3_93"><b>93.</b></a> Fabius hoped when the Carthaginians came thither,
and encamped on the plain immediately under the foot
of the hill, that he would be able to snatch away their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
plunder without any risk to himself; and, most of all, might
even put an end to the whole war by means of <span class="sidenote">Hannibal eludes
him.</span>
the excellent situation for an attack in which
he now was. He was accordingly wholly intent
on forming plans for this purpose, anxiously considering in
what direction and in what manner he should avail himself
of the advantages of the ground, and which of his men were
to be the first to attack the enemy. Whilst his enemies were
making these preparations for the next day, Hannibal, guessing
the truth, took care to give them no time or leisure for executing
their design; but summoning Hasdrubal, the captain
of his pioneers, ordered him, with all speed, to make as
many fagots of dry wood of all sorts as possible, and selecting
two thousand of the strongest of the working oxen from the
booty, to collect them outside the camp. When this was done,
he summoned the pioneers, and pointed out to them a certain
ridge lying between the camp and the gorge by which he meant
to march. To this ridge they were to drive the oxen, when
the order was given, as actively and energetically as they could,
until they came to the top. Having given these instructions,
he bade them take their supper and go to rest betimes. Towards
the end of the third watch of the night he led the pioneers out of
the camp, and ordered them to tie the fagots to the horns of the
oxen. The men being numerous, this did not take long to do;
and he then ordered them to set the fagots all alight, and to
drive the oxen off and force them to mount the ridge; and
placing his light-armed troops behind them he ordered them
to assist the drivers up to a certain distance: but, as soon as
the beasts had got well started, to take open order and pass
them at the double, and, with as much noise as possible, make
for the top of the ridge; that, if they found any of the enemy
there, they might close with and attack them at once. At the
same time he himself led the main army towards the narrow
gorge of the pass,&mdash;his heavy-armed men in front, next to them
the cavalry, then the booty, and the Iberians and Celts bringing
up the rear.</p>

<p><a name="b3_94" id="b3_94"><b>94.</b></a> The Romans who were guarding the gorge, no sooner
saw these fiery fagots advancing to the heights, than, quitting the
narrow part of the pass, they made for the ridge to meet the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
enemy. But when they got near the oxen, they were puzzled by
the lights, imagining them to be something more dangerous than
they really were; and when the Carthaginian light-armed troops
came on to the ground, after some slight skirmishing between
the two parties, upon the oxen rushing in among them, they
separated and took up their positions on different heights and
waited for daybreak, not being able to comprehend what was
taking place.</p>

<p>Partly because he was at a loss to understand what
was happening, and, in the words of the
poet, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal gets
through the pass.
Autumn, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>&#8220;some deep design suspecting;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> and
partly that, in accordance with his original
plan, he was determined not to risk a general engagement,
Fabius remained quietly within his camp: while Hannibal,
finding everything going as he designed, led his army and
booty in safety through the gorge, the men who had been set
to guard the narrow road having abandoned their post. At
daybreak, seeing the two troops fronting each other on the
heights, he sent some Iberian companies to the light-armed
troops, who engaged the Romans, and, killing a thousand of
them, easily relieved his own light-armed troops and brought
them down to the main body.</p>

<p>Having thus effected his departure from the Falernian plain,
Hannibal thenceforth busied himself in looking out for a place in
which to winter, and in making the necessary preparations, after
having inspired the utmost alarm and uncertainty in the cities
and inhabitants of Italy. <span class="sidenote">Fabius goes to
Rome, leaving
the command to
M. Minucius.</span>Though Fabius meanwhile
was in great disrepute among the common
people, for having let his enemy escape from
such a trap, he nevertheless refused to abandon
his policy; and being shortly afterwards obliged to go to Rome
to perform certain sacrifices, he handed over the command of
his legions to his master of the horse, with many parting
injunctions, not to be so anxious to inflict a blow upon the
enemy, as to avoid receiving one himself. Marcus, however,
paid no heed to the advice, and, even while Fabius was speaking,
had wholly resolved to risk a general engagement.</p>

<p><a name="b3_95" id="b3_95"><b>95.</b></a> While these things were going on in Italy, Hasdrubal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
who was in command in Iberia, having during the winter repaired
the thirty ships left him by his brother, <span class="sidenote">Spain,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>
and manned ten additional ones, got a fleet of
forty decked vessels to sea, at the beginning of the summer,
from New Carthage, under the command of Hamilcar; and at
the same time collected his land forces, and led them out of
their winter quarters. The fleet coasted up the country, and
the troops marched along the shore towards the Iber. Suspecting
their design, Gnaeus Scipio was for issuing from his
winter quarters and meeting them both by land and sea. But
hearing of the number of their troops, and the great scale on
which their preparations had been made, he gave up the idea
of meeting them by land; and manning thirty-five ships, and
taking on board the best men he could get from his land
forces to serve as marines, he put to sea, and arrived on the
second day near the mouth of the Iber. Here he came to
anchor, at a distance of about ten miles from the enemy, and
sent two swift-sailing Massilian vessels to reconnoitre. For the
sailors of Marseilles were the first in every service of difficulty
and danger, and ready at the shortest notice to do whatever
was required of them; and, in fact, Marseilles has distinguished
itself above all other places, before and since, in fidelity to
Rome, and never more so than in the Hannibalian war. The
ships sent to reconnoitre having reported that the enemy&#8217;s
fleet was lying off the mouth of the Iber, Scipio put to sea
with all speed, wishing to surprise them.</p>

<p><a name="b3_96" id="b3_96"><b>96.</b></a> But being informed in good time by his look-out
men that the enemy were bearing down upon
him, <span class="sidenote">Roman success
at sea.</span>Hasdrubal drew up his troops on the
beach, and ordered his crews to go on
board; and, when the Romans hove in sight, gave the signal
for the attack, determined to fight the enemy at sea. But,
after engaging, the Carthaginians made but a short struggle for
victory, and very soon gave way. For the support of the
troops on the beach did less service in encouraging them to
attack, than harm in offering them a safe place of retreat.
Accordingly, after losing two ships with their crews, and the
oars and marines of four others, they gave way and made for
the land; and when the Romans pressed on with spirit in pursuit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
they ran their ships ashore, and leaping from the vessels
fled for refuge to the troops. The Romans came boldly close
to land, towed off such of the vessels as could be got afloat,
and sailed away in great exultation at having beaten the enemy
at the first blow, secured the mastery of the sea, and taken
twenty-five of the enemy&#8217;s ships.</p>

<p>In Iberia therefore, after this victory, the Roman prospects
had begun to brighten. But when news of this reverse arrived
at Carthage, the Carthaginians at once despatched a fleet of
seventy ships, judging it to be essential to their whole design
that they should command the sea. These ships touched
first at Sardinia and then at Pisae in Italy, the commanders
believing that they should find Hannibal there. But the
Romans at once put to sea to attack them from Rome itself,
with a fleet of a hundred and twenty quinqueremes; and
hearing of this expedition against them, the Carthaginians
sailed back to Sardinia, and thence returned to Carthage.
Gnaeus Servilius, who was in command of this Roman fleet,
followed the Carthaginians for a certain distance, believing
that he should fall in with them; but, finding that he was far
behind, he gave up the attempt. He first put in at Lilybaeum,
and afterwards sailed to the Libyan island of Cercina; and after
receiving a sum of money from the inhabitants on condition of
not laying waste the country, he departed. On his return voyage
he took the island of Cossyrus, and having put a garrison into its
small capital, returned to Lilybaeum. There he placed the fleet,
and shortly afterwards went off himself to join the land army.</p>

<p><a name="b3_97" id="b3_97"><b>97.</b></a> When the Senate heard of Gnaeus Scipio&#8217;s naval success,
believing it to be advantageous or rather
essential not to relax their hold on Iberia, <span class="sidenote">Publius Scipio,
whose imperium
is prolonged after
his Consulship of
the previous year,
with Spain assigned
as his province,
is sent to
join his brother
there with 20
ships: early in
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>
but
to press on the war there against Carthage with
redoubled vigour, they prepared a fleet of twenty
ships, and put them under the command of
Publius Scipio; and in accordance with arrangements
already made, despatched him with all
speed to join his brother Gnaeus, and carry on
the Iberian campaign in conjunction with him.
Their great anxiety was lest the Carthaginians
should get the upper hand in Iberia, and thus possessing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
themselves of abundant supplies and recruits, should get a
more complete mastery of the sea, and assist the invasion of
Italy, by sending troops and money to Hannibal. Regarding
therefore the Iberian war as of the utmost importance, they
sent these ships and Publius Scipio to that country; who,
when he arrived in Iberia, effected a junction with his brother
and did most substantial service to the State. For up to that
time the Romans had not ventured to cross the Iber; but had
thought themselves fortunate if they could secure the friendship
and allies of the tribes up to that river. They now however
did cross it, and for the first time had the courage to
attempt a movement on the other side: their designs being
greatly favoured also by an accidental circumstance.</p>

<p>When the two brothers, after overawing the Iberian tribes
that lived near the passage of the Iber, had arrived before the
city of Saguntum, they pitched their camp about forty stades
from it, near the temple of Aphrodite, selecting the position as
offering at once security from the attacks of the enemy, and a
means of getting supplies by sea: for their fleet was coasting
down parallel with them.</p>

<p><a name="b3_98" id="b3_98"><b>98.</b></a> Here an event occurred which produced a decisive
change in their favour. When Hannibal was about to start
for Italy, <span class="sidenote">Treason of
Abilyx.</span>
from the Iberian towns whose loyalty
he suspected he took the sons of their leading
men as hostages, and placed them all in
Saguntum, because of the strength of that town and his confidence
in the fidelity of those who were left in charge
of it. Now there was a certain Iberian there named Abilyx,
who enjoyed the highest character and reputation with his
countrymen, and was believed to be especially well disposed and
loyal to the Carthaginians. Seeing how affairs were going, and
believing that the fortune of the Romans was in the ascendant,
he formed in his own mind a scheme, worthy of an Iberian
and barbarian, for giving up the hostages. Convinced that
he might obtain a high place in the favour of Rome, if he
gave a proof of his fidelity at a critical moment, he made up
his mind to turn traitor to Carthage and put the hostages in
the hands of the Romans. He began his machinations by
addressing himself to Bostar, the Carthaginian general who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
been despatched by Hasdrubal to prevent the Romans from
crossing the river, but, not venturing to do this, had retreated,
and was now encamped in the region of Saguntum next the sea.
To this man, who was of a guileless and gentle character, and
quite disposed to trust him, Abilyx now introduced the subject
of the hostages. He argued that &#8220;the Romans having now
crossed the Iber, the Carthaginians could no longer hold Iberia
by terror, but stood now in need of the good feeling of their
subjects: seeing then that the Romans had actually approached
Saguntum and were besieging it, and that the city was in
danger,&mdash;if he were to take the hostages and restore them to
their parents and cities, he would not only frustrate the
ambitious scheme of the Romans, who wished above all
things by getting possession of the hostages to have the credit
of doing this; but would also rouse a feeling of goodwill
towards Carthage in all the cities, for having taken thought for
the future and provided for the safety of the hostages. He
would, too, much enhance the favour by personally managing
this business: for if he restored these boys to their homes, he
would provoke the gratitude, not only of their parents, but of
the people at large also, by giving a striking instance of the
magnanimous policy of Carthage towards her allies. He
might even expect large rewards for himself from the families
that recovered their children; for all those, who thus unexpectedly
got into their hands the dearest objects of their
affection, would vie with each other in heaping favours on the
author of such a service.&#8221; By these and similar arguments
he persuaded Bostar to fall in with his proposals.</p>

<p><a name="b3_99" id="b3_99"><b>99.</b></a> Abilyx then went away, after arranging a fixed day on
which he would appear with everything necessary for conveying
the boys. At night he made his way to the Roman lines, and,
having fallen in with some Iberians serving in the Roman
army, was by them conducted to the generals; to whom he
discoursed at great length on the revulsion of feeling of
the Iberians in their favour, which would be caused if they
got possession of the hostages: and finally offered to put the
boys in their hands. Publius Scipio received the proposal
with extreme eagerness: and, promising him large rewards, he
agreed with him on a day, hour, and place at which a party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
were to be waiting to receive him. After returning home, Abilyx
next went with a band of chosen friends to Bostar; and, after
receiving the boys, left the camp at night, as though he wished
not to be seen by the Roman camp as he passed it, and came
at the appointed time to the place arranged, and there handed
over all the boys to the Roman officers. Publius treated
Abilyx with special honour, and employed him in restoring the
boys to their native cities, along with certain of his own
friends. He accordingly went from city to city, giving
them a visible proof by the restoration of the boys of the
Roman mildness and magnanimity, in contrast to the Carthaginian
suspiciousness and harshness; and bidding them
also observe that he had found it necessary to change sides,
he induced many Iberians to join the Roman alliance. Bostar
was thought, in thus surrendering the hostages to the enemy, to
have behaved more like a child than became a man of his age,
and was in serious danger of his life. For the present, however,
as it was getting late in the season, both sides began
dispersing into winter quarters; the Romans having made an
important step towards success in the matter of the boys.</p>

<p><a name="b3_100" id="b3_100"><b>100.</b></a> Such was the position of affairs in Iberia. To
return to Hannibal, whom we left having just
effected the passage from the Falernian plain. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal takes
Geronium.</span>
Hearing from his scouts that there was abundance
of corn in the district round Luceria and Geronium,
and that Geronium was an excellent place to store it in, he
determined to make his winter quarters there; and accordingly
marched thither by way of Mount Liburnum. And having come
to Geronium, which is about two hundred stades from Luceria,
he first endeavoured to win over the inhabitants by promises,
offering them pledges of his good faith; but when no one
would listen to him, he determined to lay siege to the town.
Having taken it without much delay, he put the inhabitants
to the sword; but preserved most of the houses and walls,
because he wished to use them as granaries for his winter
camp: and having encamped his army in front of it, he fortified
his position with trench and palisade. Having finished these
labours, he sent out two-thirds of the army to collect corn, with
orders to bring home every day, each division for the use of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
own men, as much as the regular heads of this department
would usually supply: while with the remaining third of his
army he kept watch over his camp, and occupied certain places
with a view of protecting the foraging parties in case they were
attacked. The district being mostly very accessible and flat,
and the harvesting party being almost innumerable, and the
season moreover being at the very best stage for such operations,
the amount of corn collected every day was very great.</p>

<p><a name="b3_101" id="b3_101"><b>101.</b></a> When Minucius took over the command from
Fabius, he at first kept along the line of
hills, <span class="sidenote">Minucius obtains
a slight success.
Autumn <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>feeling certain that he would sooner or
later fall in with the Carthaginians; but when
he heard that Hannibal had already taken Geronium,
and was collecting the corn of the country, and had pitched
his camp in front of the town, he changed the direction of his
march, and descended from the top of the hills by way of a
ridge leading down into the plains. Arriving at the height
which lies in the territory of Larinum, and is called Calena, he
encamped round its foot, being eager on any terms whatever to
engage the enemy. When Hannibal saw the enemy approaching,
he sent a third of his army foraging for corn, but took the
other two-thirds with him, and, advancing sixteen stades from
Geronium towards the enemy, pitched a camp upon a piece of
rising ground, with a view at once of overawing his opponents,
and affording safety to his foraging parties: and there being
another elevation between him and the two armies, which was
near, and conveniently placed for an attack upon the enemy&#8217;s
lines, he sent out about two thousand light-armed troops in
the night and seized it. At daybreak when Minucius saw
these men, he took his own light-armed troops and assaulted
the hill. After a gallant skirmish the Romans prevailed; and
subsequently their whole camp was transferred to this place.
For a certain time Hannibal kept his men for the most part
within their lines, because the camps were so close to each
other; but, after the lapse of some days, he was obliged to
divide them into two parties, one for pasturing the animals, and
one for gathering corn: being very anxious to carry out his
design of avoiding the destruction of his booty, and of collecting
as much corn as possible, that his men might have abundant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
food during the winter, and his horses and beasts of burden as
much so; for the chief hope of his army rested on his
cavalry.</p>

<p><a name="b3_102" id="b3_102"><b>102.</b></a> It was then that Minucius, seeing the great part of
the enemy scattered about the country on
these services, <span class="sidenote">Carthaginian
foragers cut off.</span>
selected the exact hour of
the day when they would be away to lead
out his army. Having come close to the Carthaginian
lines he drew out his heavy-armed troops there; and then,
dividing his cavalry and light-armed into detachments, sent
them in search of the foragers, ordering them to give no
quarter. This put Hannibal into a great difficulty: for he
was not strong enough to accept battle with the enemy drawn
up outside his lines, or to relieve those of his men who were
scattered about the country. The Romans meanwhile who
had been sent to take the foragers found a great number of
them scattered about, and killed them; while the troops drawn
up in front of the camp grew so contemptuous of the enemy,
that they even began to pull down their palisade, and all but
assaulted the Carthaginians. Hannibal was in a very dangerous
position: but in spite of the storm that had suddenly fallen
on him, he held his ground, repulsing the enemy when they
approached and defending, though with difficulty, the rampart;
until Hasdrubal came to his relief with about four thousand of
the foraging parties, who had fled for refuge from the country
and collected within the lines near Geronium. This encouraged
Hannibal to make a sally: and having got into order
of battle a short distance from the camp, he just managed with
difficulty to avert the threatened danger. After killing large
numbers of the enemy in the struggle at the camp, and still
more in the open country, Minucius for the present retired,
but with great hopes for the future; and on the morrow, the
Carthaginians having abandoned their lines on the hill, he
went up and occupied their position. For Hannibal being
alarmed lest the Romans should go by night and find the
camp at Geronium undefended, and become masters of his
baggage and stores, determined to retire thither himself and
again fix his quarters there. After this the Carthaginians were
more timid and cautious in their manner of foraging; while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Romans on the other hand acted with greater boldness and
recklessness.</p>

<p><a name="b3_103" id="b3_103"><b>103.</b></a> An exaggerated account of this success reached Rome,
and caused excessive exultation: first, <span class="sidenote">Minucius invested
with co-equal
powers with
Fabius.</span>because
in their gloomy prospects some sort of change
for the better had at last shown itself; and,
secondly, because the people could now believe
that the ill success and want of nerve, which had hitherto
attended the legions, had not arisen from the cowardice of the
men, but the timidity of their leader. Wherefore everybody
began finding fault with and depreciating Fabius, as failing to
seize his opportunities with spirit; while they extolled Minucius
to such a degree for what had happened, that a thing was done
for which there was no precedent. They gave him absolute
power as well as Fabius, believing that he would quickly put an
end to the campaign; and so there were two Dictators made for
carrying on the same war, which had never happened at Rome
before. When Minucius was informed of his popularity with the
people, and of the office bestowed upon him by the citizens, he
felt doubly incited to run all risks and act with daring boldness
against the enemy. Fabius rejoined the army with sentiments
not in the least changed by what had happened, but rather fixed
still more immovably on his original policy. Seeing, however,
that Minucius was puffed up with pride, and inclined to offer
him a jealous opposition at every turn, and was wholly bent
on risking an engagement, he offered him the choice of two
alternatives: either to command the whole army on alternate
days with him; or that they should separate their two armies,
and each command their respective part in their own way.
Minucius joyfully accepting the second alternative, they divided
the men and encamped separately about twelve stades apart.</p>

<p><a name="b3_104" id="b3_104"><b>104.</b></a> Partly from observing what was taking place, and
partly from the information of prisoners, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal draws
on Minucius.</span>Hannibal
knew of the mutual jealousy of the two
generals, and the impetuosity and ambition of
Minucius. Looking upon what was happening in the
enemy&#8217;s camp as rather in his favour than otherwise, he
set himself to deal with Minucius; being anxious to put an
end to his bold methods and check in time his adventurous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
spirit. There being then an elevation between his camp and
that of Minucius, which might prove dangerous to either, he
resolved to occupy it; and, knowing full well that, elated by his
previous success, Minucius would be certain to move out at once
to oppose his design, he concerted the following plan. The
country round the hill being bare of trees, but having much
broken ground and hollows of every description, he despatched
some men during the night, in bodies of two and three hundred,
to occupy the most favourable positions, numbering in all
five hundred horse and five thousand light-armed and other
infantry: and in order that they might not be observed in the
morning by the enemy&#8217;s foraging parties, he seized the hill at
daybreak with his light-armed troops. When Marcus saw what
was taking place, he looked upon it as an excellent opportunity;
and immediately despatched his light-armed troops, with
orders to engage the enemy and contest the possession of the
position; after these he sent his cavalry, and close behind
them he led his heavy-armed troops in person, as on the former
occasion, intending to repeat exactly the same man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p><a name="b3_105" id="b3_105"><b>105.</b></a> As the day broke, and the thoughts and eyes of all
were engrossed in observing the combatants on the hill, the
Romans had no suspicion of the troops lying in ambush. But
as Hannibal kept pouring in reinforcements for his men on the
hill, and followed close behind them himself with his cavalry
and main body, it was not long before the cavalry also of both
sides were engaged. The result was that the Roman light-armed
troops, finding themselves hard pressed by the numbers
of the cavalry, caused great confusion among the heavy-armed
troops by retreating into their lines; and the signal being
given at the same time to those who were in ambush, these
latter suddenly showed themselves and charged: whereby not
only the Roman light-armed troops, but their whole army, were
in the greatest danger. At that moment Fabius, seeing what
was taking place, <span class="sidenote">Fabius comes to
the rescue.</span>and being alarmed lest
they should sustain a complete defeat, led
out his forces with all speed and came to
the relief of his imperilled comrades. At his approach the
Romans quickly recovered their courage; and though their
lines were entirely broken up, they rallied again round their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
standards, and retired under cover of the army of Fabius, with
a severe loss in the light-armed division, and a still heavier
one in the ranks of the legions, and that too of the bravest
men. Alarmed at the freshness and perfect order of the relieving
army, Hannibal retired from the pursuit and ceased
fighting. To those who were actually engaged it was quite
clear that an utter defeat had been brought about by the
rashness of Minucius, and that their safety on this and previous
occasions had been secured by the caution of Fabius;
while those at home had a clear and indisputable demonstration
of the difference between the rashness and bravado of a
soldier, and the far-seeing prudence and cool calculation of a
general. Taught by experience the Romans joined camps
once more, and for the future listened to Fabius and obeyed
his orders: while the Carthaginians dug a trench across the
space between the knoll and their own lines, and threw up
a palisade round the crest of the captured hill; and, having
placed a guard upon it, proceeded thenceforth with their preparations
for the winter unmolested.</p>

<p><a name="b3_106" id="b3_106"><b>106.</b></a> The Consular elections being now come, the Romans

to levy new soldiers, to fill up the numbers of the legions
required for the campaign, and despatched them to headquarters;
enjoining at the same time upon Servilius that he
should by no means hazard a general engagement, but contrive
detailed skirmishes, as sharp and as frequent as he could,
for the sake of practising the raw recruits, and giving them
courage for a pitched battle: for they held the opinion that
their former defeats were owing, as much as anything else, to
the fact that they were employing troops newly levied and
entirely untrained. The Senate also sent the Praetor Lucius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Postumius into Gaul, to affect a diversion there, and induce the
Celts who were with Hannibal to return home. They also took
measures for recalling the fleet that had wintered at Lilybaeum,
and for sending to the commanders in Iberia such supplies as
were necessary for the service. Thus the Consul and Senate
were busied with these and other preparations for the campaign;
and Servilius, having received his instructions from the Consuls,
carried them out in every particular. The details of this
part of the campaign, therefore, I shall omit to record; for
nothing of importance or worth remembering occurred, partly
in consequence of these instructions, and partly from circumstances;
but there were a considerable number of skirmishes
and petty engagements, in which the Roman commanders
gained a high reputation for courage and prudence.</p>

<p><a name="b3_107" id="b3_107"><b>107.</b></a> Thus through all that winter and spring the two
armies remained encamped facing each other. <span class="sidenote">Autumn,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216.</span>
But when the season for the new harvest
was come, Hannibal began to move from the
camp at Geronium; and making up his mind that it would
be to his advantage to force the enemy by any possible
means to give him battle, he occupied the citadel of a town
called Cannae, into which the corn and other supplies from
the district round Canusium were collected by the Romans,
and conveyed thence to the camp as occasion required.
The town itself, indeed, had been reduced to ruins the year
before: but the capture of its citadel and the material of war
contained in it, caused great commotion in the Roman army;
for it was not only the loss of the place and the stores in it
that distressed them, but the fact also that it commanded the
surrounding district. They therefore sent frequent messages
to Rome asking for instructions: for if they approached the
enemy they would not be able to avoid an engagement, in view
of the fact that the country was being plundered, and the allies all
in a state of excitement. <span class="sidenote">The Senate order
a battle.</span>The Senate passed
a resolution that they should give the enemy
battle: they, however, bade Gnaeus Servilius
wait, and despatched the Consuls to the seat of war. It was
to Aemilius that all eyes turned, and on him the most confident
hopes were fixed; for his life had been a noble one, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
he was thought to have managed the recent Illyrian war with
advantage to the State. The Senate determined to bring eight
legions into the field, which had never been done at Rome
before, each legion consisting of five thousand men besides allies.
For the Romans, as I have stated before,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> habitually enrol
four legions each year, each consisting of about four thousand
foot and two hundred horse; and when any unusual necessity
arises, they raise the number of foot to five thousand and of
the horse to three hundred. Of allies, the number in each
legion is the same as that of the citizens, but of the horse three
times as great. Of the four legions thus composed, they
assign two to each of the Consuls for whatever service is going
on. Most of their wars are decided by one Consul and two
legions, with their quota of allies; and they rarely employ all
four at one time and on one service. But on this occasion, so
great was the alarm and terror of what would happen, they
resolved to bring not only four but eight legions into the field.</p>

<p><a name="b3_108" id="b3_108"><b>108.</b></a> With earnest words of exhortation, therefore, to
Aemilius, putting before him the gravity in
every point of view of the result of the battle, <span class="sidenote">The Consuls
Aemilius Paulus,
and Terentius
Varro go to the
seat of war.</span>
they despatched him with instructions to seek
a favourable opportunity to fight a decisive
battle with a courage worthy of Rome. Having
arrived at the camp and united their forces, they made known
the will of the Senate to the soldiers, and Aemilius exhorted
them to do their duty in terms which evidently came from his
heart. He addressed himself especially to explain and excuse
the reverses which they had lately experienced; for it was on
this point particularly that the soldiers were depressed and stood
in need of encouragement. <span class="sidenote">Speech of
Aemilius.</span>
&#8220;The causes,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;of
their defeats in former battles were many, and
could not be reduced to one or two. But those
causes were at an end; and no excuse existed
now, if they only showed themselves to be men of courage, for
not conquering their enemies. Up to that time both Consuls had
never been engaged together, or employed thoroughly trained
soldiers: the combatants on the contrary had been raw levies,
entirely unexperienced in danger; and what was most important
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>of all, they had been so entirely ignorant of their opponents,
that they had been brought into the field, and engaged in a
pitched battle with an enemy that they had never once set eyes
on. Those who had been defeated on the Trebia were drawn
up on the field at daybreak, on the very next morning after
their arrival from Sicily; while those who had fought in Etruria,
not only had never seen the enemy before, but did not do so
even during the very battle itself, owing to the unfortunate
state of the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a name="b3_109" id="b3_109"><b>109.</b></a> But now the conditions were quite different. For in
the first place both Consuls were with the army: and were not
only prepared to share the danger themselves, but had also
induced the Consuls of the previous year to remain and take
part in the struggle. While the men had not only seen the arms,
order, and numbers of the enemy, but had been engaged in
almost daily fights with them for the last two years. The conditions
therefore under which the two former battles were fought
being quite different, it was but natural that the result of the
coming struggle should be different too. For it would be strange
or rather impossible that those who in various skirmishes, where
the numbers of either side were equal, had for the most part
come off victorious, should, when drawn up all together, and
nearly double of the enemy in number, be defeated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherefore, men of the army,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;seeing that
we have every advantage on our side for securing a victory,
there is only one thing necessary&mdash;your determination, your
zeal! And I do not think I need say more to you on that
point. To men serving others for pay, or to those who fight as
allies on behalf of others, who have no greater danger to expect
than meets them on the field, and for whom the issues at stake
are of little importance,&mdash;such men may need words of exhortation.
But men who, like you, are fighting not for others, but
themselves,&mdash;for country, wives, and children; and for whom
the issue is of far more momentous consequence than the mere
danger of the hour, need only to be reminded: require no
exhortation. For who is there among you who would not wish
if possible to be victorious; and next, if that may not be, to
die with arms in his hands, rather than to live and see the outrage
and death of those dear objects which I have named?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Wherefore, men of the army, apart from any words of mine,
place before your eyes the momentous difference to you
between victory and defeat, and all their consequences. Enter
upon this battle with the full conviction, that in it your country
is not risking a certain number of legions, but her bare existence.
For she has nothing to add to such an army as this,
to give her victory, if the day now goes against us. All she
has of confidence and strength rests on you; all her hopes of
safety are in your hands. Do not frustrate those hopes:
but pay back to your country the gratitude you owe her; and
make it clear to all the world that the former reverses occurred,
not because the Romans are worse men than the Carthaginians,
but from the lack of experience on the part of those who were
then fighting, and through a combination of adverse circumstances.&#8221;
With such words Aemilius dismissed the troops.</p>

<p><a name="b3_110" id="b3_110"><b>110.</b></a> Next morning the two Consuls broke up their camp,
and advanced to where they heard that the enemy
were entrenched. <span class="sidenote">The Roman army
approaches
Cannae.</span>On the second day they
arrived within sight of them, and pitched their
camp at about fifty stades&#8217; distance. But when Aemilius observed
that the ground was flat and bare for some distance
round, he said that they must not engage there with an enemy
superior to them in cavalry; but that they must rather try to
draw him off, and lead him to ground on which the battle would
be more in the hands of the infantry. But Gaius Terentius being,
from inexperience, of a contrary opinion, there was a dispute
and misunderstanding between the leaders, which of all things
is the most dangerous. It is the custom, when the two Consuls
are present, that they should take the chief command
on alternate days; <span class="sidenote">Terentius Varro
orders an advance.</span>
and the next day
happening to be the turn of Terentius, he
ordered an advance with a view of approaching the enemy,
in spite of the protests and active opposition of his colleague.
Hannibal set his light-armed troops and cavalry in motion to meet
him, and charging the Romans while they were
still marching, <span class="sidenote">The Romans are
successful.</span>took them by surprise and caused
a great confusion in their ranks. The Romans
repulsed the first charge by putting some of their heavy-armed
in front; and then sending forward their light-armed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
cavalry, began to get the best of the fight all along the
line: the Carthaginians having no reserves of any importance,
while certain companies of the legionaries were mixed with the
Roman light-armed, and helped to sustain the battle. Nightfall
for the present put an end to a struggle which had not
at all answered to the hopes of the Carthaginians. But next
day Aemilius, not thinking it right to engage, and yet being
unable any longer to lead off his army, encamped with two-thirds
of it on the banks of the Aufidus, the only river which
flows right through the Apennines,&mdash;that chain of mountains
which forms the watershed of all the Italian rivers, which flow
either west to the Tuscan sea, or east to the Hadriatic. This
chain is, I say, pierced by the Aufidus, which rises on the side
of Italy nearest the Tuscan Sea, and is discharged into the
Hadriatic. For the other third of his army he caused a camp
to be made across the river, to the east of the ford, about
ten stades from his own lines, and a little more from those of
the enemy; that these men, being on the other side of the river,
might protect his own foraging parties, and threaten those of
the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b3_111" id="b3_111"><b>111.</b></a> Then Hannibal, seeing that his circumstances called
for a battle with the enemy, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal harangues
his troops.</span>being anxious
lest his troops should be depressed by
their previous reverse, and believing that
it was an occasion which required some encouraging
words, summoned a general meeting of his soldiers. When
they were assembled, he bid them all look round upon the
country, and asked them, &#8220;What better fortune they could
have asked from the gods, if they had had the choice, than to
fight in such ground as they saw there, with the vast superiority
of cavalry on their side?&#8221; And when all signified their
acquiescence in such an evident truth, he added: &#8220;First, then,
give thanks to the gods: for they have brought the enemy into
this country, because they designed the victory for us. And,
next to me, for having compelled the enemy to fight,&mdash;for
they cannot avoid it any longer,&mdash;and to fight in a place so
full of advantages for us. But I do not think it becoming in
me now to use many words in exhorting you to be brave and
forward in this battle. When you had had no experience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
fighting the Romans this was necessary, and I did then suggest
many arguments and examples to you. But now seeing that
you have undeniably beaten the Romans in three successive
battles of such magnitude, what arguments could have greater
influence with you in confirming your courage than the actual
facts? Now, by your previous battles you have got possession
of the country and all its wealth; in accordance with my
promises: for I have been absolutely true in everything I have
ever said to you. But the present contest is for the cities and
the wealth in them: and if you win it, all Italy will at once be
in your power; and freed from your present hard toils, and
masters of the wealth of Rome, you will by this battle become
the leaders and lords of the world. This, then, is a time for
deeds, not words: for by God&#8217;s blessing I am persuaded that I
shall carry out my promises to you forthwith.&#8221; His words were
received with approving shouts, which he acknowledged with
gratitude for their zeal; and having dismissed the assembly,
he at once formed a camp on the same bank of the river as
that on which was the larger camp of the Romans.</p>

<p><a name="b3_112" id="b3_112"><b>112.</b></a> Next day he gave orders that all should employ themselves
in making preparations and getting themselves into a fit
state of body. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal irritates
the enemy.</span>On the day after that he drew out his men
along the bank of the river, and showed that he was eager to
give the enemy battle. But Aemilius, dissatisfied with his
position, and seeing that the Carthaginians
would soon be obliged to shift their quarters
for the sake of supplies, kept quiet in his
camps, strengthening both with extra guards. After waiting
a considerable time, when no one came out to attack him,
Hannibal put the rest of the army into camp again, but
sent out his Numidian horse to attack the enemy&#8217;s water
parties from the lesser camp. These horsemen riding right
up to the lines and preventing the watering, Gaius Terentius
became more than ever inflamed with the desire of fighting,
and the soldiers were eager for a battle, and chafed at the
delay. For there is nothing more intolerable to mankind than
suspense; when a thing is once decided, men can but endure
whatever out of the catalogue of evils it is their misfortune to
undergo.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>But when the news arrived at Rome that the two armies
were face to face, and that skirmishes <span class="sidenote">Anxiety at
Rome.</span>
between advanced parties of both sides were
daily taking place, the city was in a state of
high excitement and uneasiness; the people dreading the
result owing to the disasters which had now befallen
them on more than one occasion; and foreseeing and anticipating
in their imaginations what would happen if they were
utterly defeated. All the oracles preserved at Rome were in
everybody&#8217;s mouth; and every temple and house was full of
prodigies and miracles: in consequence of which the city
was one scene of vows, sacrifices, supplicatory processions,
and prayers. For the Romans in times of danger take extraordinary
pains to appease gods and men, and look upon no
ceremony of that kind in such times as unbecoming or
beneath their dignity.</p>

<p><a name="b3_113" id="b3_113"><b>113.</b></a> When he took over the command on the following
day, as soon as the sun was above the horizon, <span class="sidenote">Dispositions for
the battle of
Cannae.</span>
Gaius Terentius got the army in motion from
both the camps. Those from the larger camp
he drew up in order of battle, as soon as he had got
them across the river, and bringing up those of the smaller
camp he placed them all in the same line, selecting the south
as the aspect of the whole. The Roman horse he stationed
on the right wing along the river, and their foot next them in
the same line, placing the maniples, however, closer together
than usual, and making the depth of each maniple several
times greater than its front. The cavalry of the allies
he stationed on the left wing, and the light-armed troops he
placed slightly in advance of the whole army, which amounted
with its allies to eighty thousand infantry and a little more
than six thousand horse. At the same time Hannibal brought
his Balearic slingers and spearmen across the river, and
stationed them in advance of his main body; which he led
out of their camp, and, getting them across the river at two
spots, drew them up opposite the enemy. On his left wing,
close to the river, he stationed the Iberian and Celtic horse
opposite the Roman cavalry; and next to them half the Libyan
heavy-armed foot; and next to them the Iberian and Celtic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
foot; next, the other half of the Libyans, and, on the right
wing, the Numidian horse. Having now got them all into
line he advanced with the central companies of the Iberians
and Celts; and so arranged the other companies next these in
regular gradations, that the whole line became crescent-shaped,
diminishing in depth towards its extremities: his object being
to have his Libyans as a reserve in the battle, and to commence
the action with his Iberians and Celts.</p>

<p><a name="b3_114" id="b3_114"><b>114.</b></a> The armour of the Libyans was Roman, for Hannibal
had armed them with a selection of the spoils taken in previous
battles. The shield of the Iberians and Celts was about the
same size, but their swords were quite different. For that of the
Roman can thrust with as deadly effects as it can cut, while
the Gallic sword can only cut, and that requires some room.
And the companies coming alternately,&mdash;the naked Celts, and
the Iberians with their short linen tunics bordered with purple
stripes, the whole appearance of the line was strange and terrifying.
The whole strength of the Carthaginian cavalry was
ten thousand, but that of their foot was not more than forty
thousand, including the Celts. Aemilius commanded on the
Roman right, Gaius Terentius on the left, Marcus Atilius and
Gnaeus Servilius, the Consuls of the previous year, on the
centre. The left of the Carthaginians was commanded by
Hasdrubal, the right by Hanno, the centre by Hannibal in
person, attended by his brother Mago. And as the Roman
line faced the south, as I said before, and the Carthaginian
the north, the rays of the rising sun did not inconvenience
either of them.</p>

<p><a name="b3_115" id="b3_115"><b>115.</b></a> The battle was begun by an engagement between
the advanced guard of the two armies; <span class="sidenote">The Battle, 2d
August, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216.</span>
and
at first the affair between these light-armed
troops was indecisive. But as soon as the
Iberian and Celtic cavalry got at the Romans, the battle
began in earnest, and in the true barbaric fashion: for there
was none of the usual formal advance and retreat; but when
they once got to close quarters, they grappled man to man,
and, dismounting from their horses, fought on foot. But
when the Carthaginians had got the upper hand in this encounter
and killed most of their opponents on the ground,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>&mdash;
because the Romans all maintained the fight with spirit and
determination,&mdash;and began chasing the remainder along the
river, <span class="sidenote">The Romans
outflanked by
the cavalry.</span>slaying as they went and giving no quarter; then the
legionaries took the place of the light-armed and closed
with the enemy. For a short time the Iberian and Celtic
lines stood their ground and fought gallantly; but, presently
overpowered by the weight of the heavy-armed lines, they
gave way and retired to the rear, thus breaking up the
crescent. The Roman maniples followed with spirit, and
easily cut their way through the enemy&#8217;s line; since the Celts
had been drawn up in a thin line, while the Romans had
closed up from the wings towards the centre and the point
of danger. For the two wings did not come into action at
the same time as the centre: but the centre was first engaged,
because the Gauls, having been stationed on the arc
of the crescent, had come into contact with the enemy long
before the wings, the convex of the crescent being towards the
enemy. The Romans, however, going in
pursuit of these troops, and hastily closing
in towards the centre and the part of the
enemy which was giving ground, advanced so far, that the
Libyan heavy-armed troops on either wing got on their flanks.
Those on the right, facing to the left, charged from the right
upon the Roman flank; while those who were on the left wing
faced to the right, and, dressing by the left, charged their
right flank,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> the exigency of the moment suggesting to them
what they ought to do. Thus it came about, as Hannibal
had planned, that the Romans were caught between two
hostile lines of Libyans&mdash;thanks to their impetuous pursuit of
the Celts. Still they fought, though no longer in line, yet
singly, or in maniples, which faced about to meet those who
charged them on the flanks.</p>

<p><a name="b3_116" id="b3_116"><b>116.</b></a> Though he had been from the first on the right wing,
and had taken part in the cavalry engagement, Lucius Aemilius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
still survived. Determined to act up to his own exhortatory
speech, and seeing that the decision of the battle rested
mainly on the legionaries, riding up to the centre of the line
he led the charge himself, and personally grappled with the
enemy, at the same time cheering on and exhorting his soldiers
to the charge. Hannibal, on the other side, did the same, for
he too had taken his place on the centre from the commencement.
The Numidian horse on the Carthaginian right were
meanwhile charging the cavalry on the Roman left; and though,
from the peculiar nature of their mode of fighting, they neither
inflicted nor received much harm, they yet rendered the
enemy&#8217;s horse useless by keeping them occupied, and charging
them first on one side and then on another. But when
Hasdrubal, after all but annihilating the cavalry by the river,
came from the left to the support of the Numidians, the Roman
allied cavalry, seeing his charge approaching, broke and fled.
At that point Hasdrubal appears to have acted with great skill
and discretion. Seeing the Numidians to be strong in numbers,
and more effective and formidable to troops that had once
been forced from their ground, he left the pursuit to them;
while he himself hastened to the part of the field where the
infantry were engaged, and brought his men up to support the
Libyans. Then, by charging the Roman legions on the rear,
and harassing them by hurling squadron after squadron upon
them at many points at once, he raised the spirits of the
Libyans, and dismayed and depressed those of the Romans. <span class="sidenote">Fall of Aemilius
Paulus.</span>
It was at this point that Lucius Aemilius fell,
in the thick of the fight, covered with wounds:
a man who did his duty to his country at
that last hour of his life, as he had throughout its previous
years, if any man ever did.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> As long as the Romans could
keep an unbroken front, to turn first in one direction and then
in another to meet the assaults of the enemy, they held out;
but the outer files of the circle continually falling, and the
circle becoming more and more contracted, they at last were
all killed on the field, and among them Marcus Atilius and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>Gnaeus Servilius, the Consuls of the previous year, who had
shown themselves brave men and worthy of Rome in the battle.
While this struggle and carnage were going on, the Numidian
horse were pursuing the fugitives, most of whom they cut down
or hurled from their horses; but some few escaped into Venusia,
among whom was Gaius Terentius, the Consul, who thus sought
a flight, as disgraceful to himself, as his conduct in office had
been disastrous to his country.</p>

<p><a name="b3_117" id="b3_117"><b>117.</b></a> Such was the end of the battle of Cannae, in which
both sides fought with the most conspicuous gallantry, the
conquered no less than the conquerors. This is proved by the
fact that, out of six thousand horse, only seventy escaped with
Gaius Terentius to Venusia, and about three hundred of the
allied cavalry to various towns in the neighbourhood. Of
the infantry ten thousand were taken prisoners in fair fight, but
were not actually engaged in the battle: of those who were
actually engaged only about three thousand perhaps escaped
to the towns of the surrounding district, all the rest died
nobly, to the number of seventy thousand, the Carthaginians
being on this occasion, as on previous ones, mainly indebted
for their victory to their superiority in cavalry: a lesson to
posterity that in actual war it is better to have half the
number of infantry, and the superiority in cavalry, than to
engage your enemy with an equality in both. On the side of
Hannibal there fell four thousand Celts, fifteen hundred
Iberians and Libyans, and about two hundred horse.</p>

<p>The ten thousand Romans who were captured had not,
as I said, been engaged in the actual battle; <span class="sidenote">Losses of the
Romans.</span>
and the reason was this. Lucius Aemilius
left ten thousand infantry in his camp that,
in case Hannibal should disregard the safety of his own
camp, and take his whole army on to the field, they might
seize the opportunity, while the battle was going on, of
forcing their way in and capturing the enemy&#8217;s baggage; or if,
on the other hand, Hannibal should, in view of this contingency,
leave a guard in his camp, the number of the enemy in
the field might thereby be diminished. These men were
captured in the following circumstances. Hannibal, as a
matter of fact, did leave a sufficient guard in his camp; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
as soon as the battle began, the Romans, according to their
instructions, assaulted and tried to take those thus left by
Hannibal. At first they held their own: but just as they were
beginning to waver, Hannibal, who was by this time gaining
a victory all along the line, came to their relief, and routing the
Romans, shut them up in their own camp; killed two thousand
of them; and took all the rest prisoners. In like manner the
Numidian horse brought in all those who had taken refuge in
the various strongholds about the district, amounting to two
thousand of the routed cavalry.</p>

<p><a name="b3_118" id="b3_118"><b>118.</b></a> The result of this battle, such as I have described it,
had the consequences which both sides expected. <span class="sidenote">The results of the
battle. Defection
of the allies.</span>
For the Carthaginians by their victory
were thenceforth masters of nearly the whole
of the Italian coast which is called <i>Magna Graecia</i>. Thus the
Tarentines immediately submitted; and the Arpani and some
of the Campanian states invited Hannibal to come to them;
and the rest were with one consent turning their eyes to the
Carthaginians: who, accordingly, began now to have high
hopes of being able to carry even Rome itself by assault.</p>

<p>On their side the Romans, after this disaster, despaired of
retaining their supremacy over the Italians, and were in the
greatest alarm, believing their own lives and the existence of
their city to be in danger, and every moment expecting that
Hannibal would be upon them. <span class="sidenote">Fall of Lucius
Postumius in Gaul.

<a href="#b3_106">106</a>.</span>
For, as though Fortune were
in league with the disasters that had already
befallen them to fill up the measure of their ruin,
it happened that only a few days afterwards,
while the city was still in this panic, the Praetor
who had been sent to Gaul fell unexpectedly into an ambush
and perished, and his army was utterly annihilated by the Celts.
In spite of all, however, the Senate left no means untried to
save the State. It exhorted the people to fresh exertions,
strengthened the city with guards, and deliberated on the
crisis in a brave and manly spirit. And subsequent events
made this manifest. For though the Romans were on that
occasion indisputably beaten in the field, and had lost reputation
for military prowess; by the peculiar excellence of their
political constitution, and the prudence of their counsels, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
not only recovered their supremacy over Italy, by eventually
conquering the Carthaginians, but before very long became
masters of the whole world.</p>

by the 140th Olympiad. When I have

to a formal account of the Roman constitution itself; for I
think that a description of it will not only be germane to the
matter of my history, but will also be of great help to practical
statesmen, as well as students, either in reforming or establishing
other constitutions.</p>

<h2>BOOK IV</h2>

<p><a name="b4_1" id="b4_1"><b>1.</b></a> <span class="smcap">In</span> my former book I explained the causes of the second
war between Rome and Carthage; and described Hannibal&#8217;s
invasion of Italy, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220-216.</span>and the engagements which took place between
them up to the battle of Cannae, on the banks of the Aufidus.
I shall now take up the history of Greece during
the same period, ending at the same date, and
commencing from the 140th Olympiad. But I shall first recall
to the recollection of my readers what I stated in my second book
on the subject of the Greeks, and especially of the Achaeans;
for the league of the latter has made extraordinary progress up
to our own age and the generation immediately preceding.</p>

<p>I started, then, from Tisamenus, one of the sons of Orestes,
and stated that the dynasty existed from his
time to that of Ogygus: <span class="sidenote">Recapitulation of
Achaean history,
before <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220,
contained in Book
II., cc. 41-71.</span>that then there was an
excellent form of democratical federal government
established: and that then the league was
broken up by the kings of Sparta into separate
towns and villages. Then I tried to describe how these towns
began to form a league once more: which were the first to
join; and the policy subsequently pursued, which led to their
inducing all the Peloponnesians to adopt the general title
of Achaeans, and to be united under one
federal government. <span class="sidenote">Ending with the

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220-216.</span>Descending to particulars,
I brought my story up to the flight of
Cleomenes, King of Sparta: then briefly summarising
the events included in my prefatory
sketch up to the deaths of Antigonus Doson,

who all three died at about the same time, I
announced that my main history was to begin from that point.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b4_2" id="b4_2"><b>2.</b></a> I thought this was the best point; first, because it is there
that Aratus leaves off, and I meant my work, <span class="sidenote">Reasons for starting

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;224-220.</span>
as
far as it was Greek history, to be a continuation
of his; and, secondly, because the period thus
embraced in my history would fall partly in the
life of my father, and partly in my own; and
thus I should be able to speak as eye-witness
of some of the events, and from the information
of eye-witnesses of others. To go further back
and write the report of a report, traditions at
second or third hand, seemed to me unsatisfactory
either with a view to giving clear impressions
or making sound statements. But, above
all, I began at this period because it was then that the history
of the whole world entered on a new phase. Philip, son of
Demetrius, had just become the boy king of Macedonia;
Achaeus, prince of Asia on this side of Taurus, had converted
his show of power into a reality; Antiochus the Great had, a
short time before, by the death of his brother Seleucus,
succeeded while quite a young man to the throne of Syria;
Ariarathes to that of Cappadocia; and Ptolemy Philopator to
that of Egypt. Not long afterwards Lycurgus became King of
Sparta, and the Carthaginians had recently elected Hannibal
general to carry on the war lately described. Every government
therefore being changed about this time, there seemed
every likelihood of a new departure in policy: which is but
natural and usual, and in fact did at this time occur. For
the Romans and Carthaginians entered upon the war I have
described; Antiochus and Ptolemy on one for the possession
of Coele-Syria; and the Achaeans and Philip one against the
Aetolians and Lacedaemonians. The causes of this last war
must now be stated.</p>

<p><a name="b4_3" id="b4_3"><b>3.</b></a> The Aetolians had long been discontented with a state of
peace and tired at living at their own charges; <span class="sidenote">The Aetolians.</span>
for they were accustomed to live on their neighbours,
and their natural ostentation required abundant means
to support it. Enslaved by this passion they live a life as
predatory as that of wild beasts, respecting no tie of friendship
and regarding every one as an enemy to be plundered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>Hitherto, however, as long as Antigonus Doson was alive, their
fear of the Macedonians had kept them quiet. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;222.</span>But when he
was succeeded at his death by the boy Philip,
they conceived a contempt for the royal power,
and at once began to look out for a pretext and opportunity
for interfering in the Peloponnese: induced partly by an old
habit of getting plunder from that country, and partly by
the belief that, now the Achaeans were unsupported by
Macedonia, they would be a match for them. While their
thoughts were fixed on this, chance to a certain extent contributed
to give them the opportunity which they desired.</p>

<p>There was a certain man of Trichonium<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> named Dorimachus,
son of that Nicostratus who made the
treacherous attack <span class="sidenote">The raids of
Dorimachus in
Messenia.</span>on the Pan-Boeotian congress.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
This Dorimachus, being young and inspired
with the true spirit of Aetolian violence and aggressiveness,
was sent by the state to Phigalea in the Peloponnese, which,
being on the borders of Arcadia and Messenia, happened at
that time to be in political union with the Aetolian league.
His mission was nominally to guard the city and territory of
Phigalea, but in fact to act as a spy on the politics of the
Peloponnese. A crowd of pirates flocked to him at Phigalea;
and being unable to get them any booty by fair means, because
the peace between all Greeks which Antigonus had concluded
was still in force, he was finally reduced to allowing the pirates
to drive off the cattle of the Messenians, though they were friends
and allies of the Aetolians. These injurious acts were at first
confined to the sheep on the border lands; but becoming more
and more reckless and audacious, they even ventured to break
into the farm-houses by sudden attacks at night. The
Messenians were naturally indignant, and sent embassies to
Dorimachus; which he at first disregarded, because he wanted
not only to benefit the men under him, but himself also, by
getting a share in their spoils. But when the arrival of such embassies
became more and more frequent, owing to the perpetual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>recurrence of these acts of depredation, he said at last that he
would come in person to Messene, and decide on the claims
they had to make against the Aetolians. When he came,
however, and the sufferers appeared, he laughed at some,
threatened to strike others, and drove others away with abusive
language.</p>

<p><a name="b4_4" id="b4_4"><b>4.</b></a> Even while he was actually in Messene, the pirates
came close to the city walls in the night, and by means of
scaling-ladders broke into a country-house called Chiron&#8217;s
villa; killed all the slaves who resisted them; and having
bound the others, <span class="sidenote">Dorimachus
leaves Messene.</span>
took them and the cattle away
with them. The Messenian Ephors had long
been much annoyed by what was going on, and
by the presence of Dorimachus in their town; but this they
thought was too insolent: and they accordingly summoned
him to appear before the assembled magistrates. There
Sciron, who happened to be an Ephor at the time, and enjoyed
a high reputation for integrity among his fellow-citizens,
advised that they should not allow Dorimachus to leave the
city, until he had made good all the losses sustained by the
Messenians, and had given up the guilty persons to be
punished for the murders committed. This suggestion being
received with unanimous approval, as but just, Dorimachus
passionately exclaimed that &#8220;they were fools if they imagined
that they were now insulting only Dorimachus, and not the
Aetolian league.&#8221; In fact he expressed the greatest indignation
at the whole affair, and said that &#8220;they would meet with
a public punishment, which would serve them well right.&#8221;
Now there was at that time in Messene a man of disgraceful
and effeminate character named Babyrtas, who was so exactly
like Dorimachus in voice and person, that, when he was dressed
in Dorimachus&#8217;s sun-hat and cloak, it was impossible to tell
them apart; and of this Dorimachus was perfectly aware. When
therefore he was speaking in these threatening and insolent
tones to the Messenian magistrates, Sciron lost his temper and
said &#8220;Do you think we care for you or your threats,
<i>Babyrtas</i>?&#8221; After this Dorimachus was compelled for the
present to yield to circumstances, and to give satisfaction for
the injuries inflicted upon the Messenians: but when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
returned to Aetolia, he nursed such a bitter and furious feeling
of anger at this taunt, that, without any other reasonable pretext,
but for this cause and this alone, he got up a war against
the Messenians.</p>

<p><a name="b4_5" id="b4_5"><b>5.</b></a> The Strategus of the Aetolians at that time was Ariston;
but being from physical infirmities unable to
serve in the field, <span class="sidenote">Dorimachus becomes
practically
Strategus of
Aetolia, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;221.</span>and being a kinsman of
Dorimachus and Scopas, he had somehow or
another surrendered his whole authority to the
former. In his public capacity Dorimachus could not venture
to urge the Aetolians to undertake the Messenian war, because
he had no reasonable pretext for so doing: the origin of his wish
being, as everybody well knew, the wrongs committed by himself
and the bitter gibe which they had brought upon him. He
therefore gave up the idea of publicly advocating the war, <span class="sidenote">He induces
Scopas to go
to war with
Messenia, Epirus,
Achaia, Acarnania,
and
Macedonia.</span>
but
tried privately to induce Scopas to join in the
intrigue against the Messenians: He pointed
out that there was now no danger from the side
of Macedonia owing to the youth of the king
(Philip being then only seventeen years old);
that the Lacedaemonians were alienated from
the Messenians; and that they possessed the affection and
alliance of the Eleans; and these circumstances taken together
would make an invasion of Messenia perfectly safe. But the
argument most truly Aetolian which he used was to put before
him that a great booty was to be got from Messenia, because it
was entirely unguarded, and had alone, of all the Peloponnesian
districts, remained unravaged throughout the Cleomenic war.
And, to sum up all, he argued that such a move would secure
them great popularity with the Aetolians generally. And if
the Achaeans were to try to hinder their march through the
country, they would not be able to complain if they retaliated:
and if, on the other hand, they did not stir, would be no
hindrance to their enterprise. Besides, he affirmed that they
would have plenty of pretext against the Messenians; for they
had long been in the position of aggressors by promising the
Achaeans and Macedonians to join their alliance.</p>

<p>By these, and similar arguments to the same effect, he
roused such a strong feeling in the minds of Scopas and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
friends, that, without waiting for a meeting of the Aetolian
federal assembly, and without communicating with the Apocleti
or taking any of the proper constitutional steps, of their
own mere impulse and opinion they committed acts of hostility
simultaneously against Messenia, Epirus, Achaia, Acarnania,
and Macedonia.</p>

<p><a name="b4_6" id="b4_6"><b>6.</b></a> By sea they immediately sent out privateers, who, falling
in with a royal vessel of Macedonia near
Cythera, <span class="sidenote">Acts of hostility
against
Macedonia,</span>
brought it with all its crew to Aetolia,
and sold ship-owners, sailors, and marines, and
finally the ship itself. Then they began sacking the seaboard
of Epirus, employing the aid of some Cephallenian
ships for carrying out this act of violence. <span class="sidenote">Epirus,
and Acarnania.</span>
They tried also to capture Thyrium in Acarnania.
At the same time they secretly sent some men to
seize a strong place called Clarium, in the centre of the territory
of Megalopolis; which they used thenceforth as a place of
sale for their spoils, and a starting place for their marauding
expeditions. However Timoxenus, the Achaean Strategus,
with the assistance of Taurion, who had been left by Antigonus
in charge of the Macedonian interests in the Peloponnese,
took the place after a siege of a very few days. For
Antigonus retained Corinth, in accordance with his convention
with the Achaeans, made at the time of the Cleomenic war;<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
and had never restored Orchomenus to the Achaeans after he
had taken it by force, but claimed and retained it in his own
hands; with the view, as I suppose, not only of commanding
the entrance of the Peloponnese, but of guarding also its interior
by means of his garrison and warlike apparatus in
Orchomenus.</p>

<p>Dorimachus and Scopas waited until Timoxenus had a
very short time of office left, and when Aratus, though elected
by the Achaeans for the coming year, would not yet be in
office;<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> and then collecting a general levy of Aetolians at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>

ships ready to convoy them, <span class="sidenote">Before midsummer
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.
Invasion of
Messenia by
Dorimachus and
Scopas.</span>
they got
their men across to the Peloponnese, and led
them against Messenia. While marching through
the territories of Patrae, Pharae, and Tritaea
they pretended that they did not wish to do any
injury to the Achaeans; but their forces, from
their inveterate passion for plunder, could not be restrained
from robbing the country; and consequently they committed
outrages and acts of violence all along their line of march, till
they arrived at Phigalea. Thence, by a bold and sudden
movement, they entered Messenia; and without any regard
for their ancient friendship and alliance with the Messenians, or
for the principles of international justice common to all mankind,
subordinating every consideration to their selfish greed,
they set about plundering the country without resistance, the
Messenians being absolutely afraid to come out to attack them.</p>

<p><a name="b4_7" id="b4_7"><b>7.</b></a> This being the time, according to their laws, for the
meeting of the Achaean federal assembly, <span class="sidenote">The Achaean
league decide
to assist the
Messenians.</span>the
members arrived at Aegium. When the assembly
met, the deputies from Patrae and Pharae made
a formal statement of the injuries inflicted upon
their territories during the passage of the Aetolians: an embassy
from Messenia also appeared, begging for their assistance
on the ground that the treatment from which they were suffering
was unjust and in defiance of treaty. When these statements
were heard, great indignation was felt at the wrongs of
Patrae and Pharae, and great sympathy for the misfortunes of
the Messenians. But it was regarded as especially outrageous
that the Aetolians should have ventured to enter Achaia with
an army, contrary to treaty, without obtaining or even asking
for permission from any one to pass through the country.
Roused to indignation by all these considerations, the assembly
voted to give assistance to the Messenians: that the
Strategus should summon a general levy of the Achaean
arms: and that whatever was decided by this levy, when it met,
should be done. Now Timoxenus, the existing Strategus, was
just on the point of quitting office, and felt besides small confidence
in the Achaeans, because martial exercise had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
allowed to fall into neglect among them; he therefore shrank
from undertaking the expedition, or from even summoning
the popular levy. The fact was that, after the expulsion
of Cleomenes, King of Sparta, the Peloponnesians, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;222-221.</span>
weary of the wars that had taken
place, and trusting to the peaceful arrangement that had
been come to, neglected all warlike preparations. Aratus,
however, indignant and incensed at the audacity of the
Aetolians, was not inclined to take things so calmly,
for he had in fact a grudge of long standing against these
people. Wherefore he was for instantly summoning the
Achaeans to an armed levy, and was all eagerness to attack
the Aetolians. <span class="sidenote">Aratus becomes
Strategus of the
Achaean league,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220
(May-June).</span>
Eventually he took over from
Timoxenus the seal of the league, five days
before the proper time, and wrote to the various
cities summoning a meeting in arms of all those
who were of the military age, at Megalopolis.
But the peculiar character of this man, I think, makes it
proper for me to give a brief preliminary sketch of him.</p>

<p><a name="b4_8" id="b4_8"><b>8.</b></a> Aratus had many of the qualities of a great ruler. He
could speak, and contrive, and conceal his purpose: <span class="sidenote">Character of
Aratus.</span>
no one surpassed him in the moderation
which he showed in political contests, or in his
power of attaching friends and gaining allies: in intrigue,
stratagem, and laying plots against a foe, and in bringing
them to a successful termination by personal endurance and
courage, he was pre-eminent. Many clear instances of these
qualities may be found; but none more convincing than the
episodes of the capture of Sicyon and Mantinea, of the expulsion
of the Aetolians from Pellene, and especially of the surprise of
the Acrocorinthus.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> On the other hand whenever he attempted
a campaign in the field, he was slow in conception and timid
in execution, and without personal gallantry in the presence of
danger. The result was that the Peloponnese was full of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>trophies which marked reverses sustained by him; and that in
this particular department he was always easily defeated. So
true is it that men&#8217;s minds, no less than their bodies, have
many aspects. Not only is it the case that the same man has
an aptitude for one class of activities and not for another; it
often happens that in things closely analogous, the same man
will be exceedingly acute and exceedingly dull, exceedingly
courageous and exceedingly timid. Nor is this a paradox: it
is a very ordinary fact, well known to all attentive observers.
For instance you may find men who in hunting show the
greatest daring in grappling with wild beasts, and yet are utter
cowards in the presence of an armed enemy. Or again, in
actual war some are active and skilful in single combats, who
are yet quite ineffective in the ranks. For example, the
Thessalian cavalry in squadron and column are irresistible, but
when their order is once broken up, they have not the skill
in skirmishing by which each man does whatever the time and
place suggests: while, on the other hand, exactly the reverse of
this is the case with the Aetolians. The Cretans, again, either
by land or sea, in ambushes and piratical excursions, in deceiving
the enemy, in making night attacks, and in fact in
every service which involves craft and separate action, are
irresistible; but for a regular front to front charge in line
they have neither the courage nor firmness; and the reverse
again is the case with the Achaeans and Macedonians.</p>

<p>I have said thus much, that my readers may not refuse me
credit if I have at times to make contradictory statements
about the same men and in regard to analogous employments.
To return to my narrative.</p>

<p><a name="b4_9" id="b4_9"><b>9.</b></a> The men of military age having assembled in arms at
Megalopolis, in accordance with the decree of
the federal assembly, <span class="sidenote">The armed levy
of Achaeans
summoned.</span>
the Messenian envoys once
more came forward, and entreated the people not
to disregard the flagrant breach of treaty from which they were
suffering; and expressed their willingness to become allies of
the league, and their anxiety to be enrolled among its members.
The Achaean magistrates declined the offered alliance, on the
ground that it was impossible to admit a new member without the
concurrence of Philip and the other allies,&mdash;for the sworn alliance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
negotiated by Antigonus during the Cleomenic war was
still in force, and included Achaia, Epirus, Phocis, Macedonia,
Boeotia, Acarnania, and Thessaly;&mdash;but they said that they
would march out to their relief, if the envoys there present
would place their sons in Sparta, as hostages for their promise
not to make terms with the Aetolians without the consent of
the Achaeans. The Spartans among the rest were encamped
on the frontier of Megalopolis, having marched out in accordance
with the terms of their alliance; but they were acting
rather as reserves and spectators than as active allies. <span class="sidenote">Dorimachus
ordered to quit
Messenia without
passing through
Achaia.</span>
Having
thus settled the terms of the arrangement with
the Messenians, Aratus sent a messenger to the
Aetolians to inform them of the decree of the
Achaean federation, and to order them to quit
the territory of Messenia without entering that
of Achaia, on pain of being treated as enemies if they set foot
in it. When they heard the message and knew that the
Achaeans were mustered in force, Scopas and Dorimachus
thought it best for the present to obey. <span class="sidenote">Scopas and
Dorimachus prepare
to obey.</span>
They
therefore at once sent despatches to Cyllene and
to the Aetolian Strategus, Ariston, begging that
the transports should be sent to a place on the coast of Elis called
the island of Pheia;<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> and they themselves two days later
struck camp, and laden with booty marched towards Elis.
For the Aetolians always maintained a friendship with the
Eleans that they might have through them an entrance for
their plundering and piratical expeditions into the Peloponnese.</p>

<p><a name="b4_10" id="b4_10"><b>10.</b></a> Aratus waited two days: and then, foolishly believing
that the Aetolians would return by the route
they had indicated, <span class="sidenote">Aratus dismisses
the Achaean levy,
with the exception
of 3000 foot and
300 horse.</span>
he dismissed all the Achaeans
and Lacedaemonians to their homes, except
three thousand foot and three hundred horse
and the division under Taurion, which he led to
Patrae, with the view of keeping on the flank of the Aetolians.
But when Dorimachus learnt that Aratus was
thus watching his march, and was still under
<span class="sidenote">Dorimachus turns
upon Aratus.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>arms; partly from fear of being attacked when his forces
were engaged on the embarkation, and partly with a view
to confuse the enemy, he sent his booty on to the
transports with a sufficient number of men to secure their
passage, under orders to meet him at Rhium where he intended
to embark; while he himself, after remaining for a time
to superintend and protect the shipment of the booty, changed
the direction of his march and advanced towards Olympia.
But hearing that Taurion, with the rest of the army, was near
Cleitoria; and feeling sure that in these circumstances he would
not be able to effect the crossing from Rhium without danger
and a struggle with the enemy; he made up his mind that it
would be best for his interests to bring on an engagement with
the army of Aratus as soon as possible, since it was weak in
numbers and wholly unprepared for the attack. He calculated
that if he could defeat this force, he could then plunder the
country, and effect his crossing from Rhium in safety, while
Aratus was waiting and deliberating about again convoking
the Achaean levy; but if on the other hand Aratus were
terrified and declined the engagement, he would then effect his
departure unmolested, whenever he thought it advisable. With
these views, therefore, he advanced, and pitched his camp at
Methydrium in the territory of Megalopolis.</p>

<p><a name="b4_11" id="b4_11"><b>11.</b></a> But the leaders of the Achaeans, on learning the
arrival of the Aetolians, adopted a course of proceeding
quite unsurpassable for folly. <span class="sidenote">The Battle of
Caphyae,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>They
left the territory of Cleitor and encamped at
Caphyae; but the Aetolians marching from Methydrium past
the city of Orchomenus, they led the Achaean troops into the
plain of Caphyae, and there drew them up for battle, with the
river which flows through that plain protecting their front.
The difficulty of the ground between them and their enemy,
for there were besides the river a number of ditches not easily
crossed,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> and the show of readiness on the part of the Achaeans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>for the engagement, caused the Aetolians to shrink from
attacking according to their original purpose; but they retreated
in good order to the high ground of Oligyrtus, content
if only they were not attacked and forced to give battle. But
Aratus, when the van of the Aetolians was already making
the ascent, while the cavalry were bringing up the rear along
the plain, and were approaching a place called Propus at the
foot of the hills, sent out his cavalry and light-armed troops,
under the command of Epistratus of Acarnania, with orders to
attack and harass the enemy&#8217;s rear. Now if an engagement
was necessary at all, they ought not to have attempted it with
the enemy&#8217;s rear, when they had already accomplished the
march through the plain, but with his van directly it had
debouched upon the plain: for in this way the battle would
have been wholly confined to the plain and level ground,
where the peculiar nature of the Aetolian arms and general
tactics would have been least effective; while the Achaeans,
from precisely opposite reasons, would have been most effective
and able to act. As it was, they surrendered the advantages
of time and place which were in their favour, and deliberately
accepted the conditions which were in favour of the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b4_12" id="b4_12"><b>12.</b></a> Naturally the result of the engagement was in harmony
with such a beginning. For when the light-armed
troops approached, <span class="sidenote">The Achaeans
defeated.</span>
the Aetolian cavalry
retired in good order up the hill, being anxious
to effect a junction with their own infantry. But Aratus,
having an imperfect view of what was going on, and making
a bad conjecture of what would happen next, no sooner saw
the cavalry retiring, than, hoping that they were in absolute
flight, he sent forward the heavy-armed troops of his two wings,
with orders to join and support the advanced guard of their
light-armed troops; while he himself, with his remaining forces,
executed a flank movement, and led his men on at the double.
But the Aetolian cavalry had now cleared the plain, and, having
effected the junction with their infantry, drew up under cover
of the hill; massed the infantry on their flanks; and called to
them to stand by them: the infantry themselves showing great
promptness in answering to their shouts, and in coming to
their relief, as the several companies arrived. Thinking themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
now sufficiently strong in numbers, they closed their
ranks, and charged the advanced guard of Achaean cavalry
and light armed troops; and being superior in number, and
having the advantage of charging from higher ground, after a
long struggle, they finally turned their opponents to flight:
whose flight involved that of the heavy-armed troops also which
were coming to their relief. For the latter were advancing in
separate detachments in loose order, and, either in dismay at
what was happening, or upon meeting their flying comrades on
their retreat, were compelled to follow their example: the result
being that, whereas the number of those actually defeated on
the field was less than five hundred, the number that fled was
more than two thousand. Taught by experience what to do,
the Aetolians followed behind them with round after round of
loud and boisterous shouts. The Achaeans at first retreated
in good order and without danger, because they were retiring
upon their heavy-armed troops, whom they imagined to be in
a place of safety on their original ground; but when they saw
that these too had abandoned their position of safety, and were
marching in a long straggling line, some of them immediately
broke off from the main body and sought refuge in various
towns in the neighbourhood; while others, meeting the phalanx
as it was coming up to their relief, proved to be quite sufficient,
without the presence of an enemy, to strike fear into it and
force it into headlong flight. They directed their flight, as I
said, to the towns of the neighbourhood. Orchomenus and
Caphyae, which were close by, saved large numbers of them:
and if this had not been the case, they would in all probability
have been annihilated by this unlooked-for catastrophe.
Such was the result of the engagement at Caphyae.</p>

<p><a name="b4_13" id="b4_13"><b>13.</b></a> When the people of Megalopolis learnt that the Aetolians
were at Methydrium, they came to the rescue <i>en masse</i>, <span class="sidenote">The Aetolians
retire at their
leisure.</span>at
the summons of a trumpet, on the very day
after the battle of Caphyae; and were compelled
to bury the very men with whose assistance
they had expected to fight the Aetolians. Having
therefore dug a trench in the territory of Caphyae, and
collected the corpses, they performed the funeral rites of these
unhappy men with all imaginable honour. But the Aetolians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
after this unlooked-for success gained by the cavalry and light-armed
troops, traversed the Peloponnese from that time in
complete security. In the course of their march they made
an attack upon the town of Pellene, and, after ravaging the
territory of Sicyon, finally quitted the Peloponnese by way of
the Isthmus.</p>

<p>This then, was the cause and occasion of the Social war:
its formal beginning was the decree passed by all the allies
after these events, which was confirmed by a general meeting
held at Corinth, on the proposal of King Philip, who presided
at the assembly.</p>

<p><a name="b4_14" id="b4_14"><b>14.</b></a> A few days after the events just narrated the ordinary
meeting of the Achaean federal assembly
took place, <span class="sidenote">Midsummer,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
and Aratus was bitterly denounced,
publicly as well as privately, as indisputably
responsible for this disaster; and the anger of the general
public was still further roused and embittered by the
invectives of his political opponents. It was shown to
every one&#8217;s satisfaction that Aratus had been guilty of
four flagrant errors. His first was that, having taken office
before his predecessor&#8217;s time was legally at an end, he had
availed himself of a time properly belonging to another to
engage in the sort of enterprise in which he
was conscious of having often failed. <span class="sidenote">Attacked at the
Achaean Congress,
Aratus successfully
defends himself.</span>
His
second and graver error was the disbanding the
Achaeans, while the Aetolians were still in the
middle of the Peloponnese; especially as he had been well
aware beforehand that Scopas and Dorimachus were anxious
to disturb the existing settlement, and to stir up war. His
third error was to engage the enemy, as he did, with such a
small force, without any strong necessity; when he might have
retired to the neighbouring towns and have summoned a levy
of the Achaeans, and then have engaged, if he had thought
that measure absolutely necessary. But his last and gravest
error was that, having determined to fight, he did so in such
an ill-considered manner, and managed the business with so
little circumspection, as to deprive himself of the advantages
of the plain and the support of his heavy-armed troops, and
allow the battle to be settled by light-armed troops, and to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
place on the slopes, than which nothing could have been more
advantageous or convenient to the Aetolians. Such were the
allegations against Aratus. He, however, came forward and
reminded the assembly of his former political services and
achievements; and urged in his defence that, in the matters
alleged, his was not the blame for what had occurred. He
begged their indulgence if he had been guilty of any oversight
in the battle, and claimed that they should at any rate look at
the facts without prejudice or passion. These words created
such a rapid and generous change in the popular feeling, that
great indignation was roused against the political opponents
who attacked him; and the resolutions as to the measures to
be taken in the future were passed wholly in accordance with
the views of Aratus.</p>

<p><a name="b4_15" id="b4_15"><b>15.</b></a> These events occurred in the previous Olympiad,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> what

The resolutions passed by the Achaean
federal assembly were these. That embassies
should be sent to Epirus, Boeotia, Phocis,
Acarnania, and Philip,
to declare how the Aetolians, in defiance
of treaty, had twice entered Achaia with arms,
<span class="sidenote">The Achaean
league determine
upon war with
the Aetolians,
and send round
to their allies for
assistance.</span>
and to call upon them for assistance in virtue of
their agreement, and for their consent to the
admission of the Messenians into the alliance.
Next, that the Strategus of the Achaeans should
enrol five thousand foot and five hundred horse,
and support the Messenians in case the Aetolians were to invade
their territory; and to arrange with the Lacedaemonians
and Messenians how many horse and foot were to be supplied
by them severally for the service of the league. These decrees
showed a noble spirit on the part of the Achaeans in the
presence of defeat, which prevented them from abandoning
either the cause of the Messenians or their own purpose.
Those who were appointed to serve on these embassies to the
allies proceeded to carry them out; while the Strategus at once,
in accordance with the decree, set about enrolling the troops
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>from Achaia, and arranged with the Lacedaemonians and
Messenians to supply each two thousand five hundred infantry
and two hundred and fifty cavalry, so that the whole army for
the coming campaign should amount to ten thousand foot and
a thousand horse.</p>

<p>On the day of their regular assembly the Aetolians also
met and decided to maintain peace with the Spartans and
Messenians; hoping by that crafty measure to tamper with the
loyalty of the Achaean allies and sow disunion among them.
With the Achaeans themselves they voted to maintain peace,
on condition that they withdrew from alliance with Messenia,
and to proclaim war if they refused,&mdash;than which nothing
could have been more unreasonable. For being themselves in
alliance, both with Achaeans and Messenians, they proclaimed
war against the former, unless the two ceased to be in
alliance and friendly relationship with each other; while if
the Achaeans chose to be at enmity with the Messenians,
they offered them a separate peace. Their proposition was
too iniquitous and unreasonable to admit of being even
considered.</p>

<p><a name="b4_16" id="b4_16"><b>16.</b></a> The Epirotes and King Philip on hearing the ambassadors
consented to admit the Messenians to alliance; but though
the conduct of the Aetolians caused them momentary indignation,
they were not excessively moved by it, because it was no
more than what the Aetolians habitually did. Their anger,
therefore, was short-lived, and they presently voted against
going to war with them. So true is it that an habitual course
of wrong-doing finds readier pardon than when it is spasmodic
or isolated. The former, at any rate, was the case with the
Aetolians: they perpetually plundered Greece, and levied unprovoked
war upon many of its people: they did not deign either
to make any defence to those who complained, but answered
only by additional insults if any one challenged them to arbitration
for injuries which they had inflicted, or indeed which they
meditated inflicting. <span class="sidenote">Treachery of the
Spartans.</span>And yet the Lacedaemonians,
who had but recently been liberated
by means of Antigonus and the generous zeal
of the Achaeans, and though they were bound not to commit
any act of hostility towards the Macedonians and Philip, sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
clandestine messages to the Aetolians, and arranged a secret
treaty of alliance and friendship with them.</p>

<p>The army had already been enrolled from the Achaeans of
military age, and had been assigned to the duty
of assisting the Lacedaemonians and Messenians, <span class="sidenote">Invasion of
Achaia by the
Aetolians and
Illyrians.</span>
when Scerdilaidas and Demetrius of
Pharos sailed with ninety galleys beyond Lissus,
contrary to the terms of their treaty with Rome. These men
first touched at Pylos, and failing in an attack upon it, they
separated: Demetrius making for the Cyclades, from some
of which he exacted money and plundered others; while
Scerdilaidas, directing his course homewards, put in at Naupactus
with forty galleys at the instigation of Amynas, king of
the Athamanes, who happened to be his brother-in-law; and
after making an agreement with the Aetolians, by the agency
of Agelaus, for a division of spoils, he promised to join them
in their invasion of Achaia. With this agreement made with
Scerdilaidas, and with the co-operation of the city of Cynaetha,
Agelaus, Dorimachus, and Scopas, collected a general levy
of the Aetolians, and invaded Achaia in conjunction with the
Illyrians.</p>

<p><a name="b4_17" id="b4_17"><b>17.</b></a> But the Aetolian Strategus Ariston, ignoring everything
that was going on, remained quietly at home, asserting that he
was not at war with the Achaeans, but was maintaining peace:
a foolish and childish mode of acting,&mdash;for what better epithets
could be applied to a man who supposed that he could cloak
notorious facts by mere words? Meanwhile Dorimachus and
his colleague had marched through the Achaean territory and
suddenly appeared at Cynaetha.</p>

<p>Cynaetha was an Arcadian city<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> which, for many years past,
had been afflicted with implacable and violent
political factions. <span class="sidenote">The previous history
of Cynaetha.</span>
The two parties had frequently
retaliated on each other with massacres,
banishments, confiscations, and redivisions of lands; but
finally the party which affected the Achaean connexion prevailed
and got possession of the city, securing themselves by a
city-guard and commandant from Achaia. This was the state
of affairs when, shortly before the Aetolian invasion, the exiled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>party sent to the party in possession intreating that they would
be reconciled and allow them to return to their own city;
whereupon the latter were persuaded, and sent an embassy to
the Achaeans with the view of obtaining their consent to the
pacification. The Achaeans readily consented, in the belief
that both parties would regard them with goodwill: since the
party in possession had all their hopes centred in the Achaeans,
while those who were about to be restored would owe that
restoration to the consent of the same people. Accordingly
the Cynaethans dismissed the city guard and commandant, and
restored the exiles, to the number of nearly three hundred,
after taking such pledges from them as are reckoned the most
inviolable among all mankind. But no sooner had they
secured their return, than, without any cause or pretext arising
which might give a colour to the renewal of the quarrel, but
on the contrary, at the very first moment of their restoration,
they began plotting against their country, and against those who
had been their preservers. I even believe that at the very
sacrifices, which consecrated the oaths and pledges which they
gave each other, they were already, even at such a solemn
moment, revolving in their minds this offence against religion
and those who had trusted them. For, as soon as they were
restored to their civil rights they called in the Aetolians, and
betrayed the city into their hands, eager to effect the utter ruin
both of the people who had preserved, and the city which had
nourished, them.</p>

<p><a name="b4_18" id="b4_18"><b>18.</b></a> The bold stroke by which they actually consummated
this treason was as follows. Of the restored exiles certain
officers had been appointed called Polemarchs, whose duty it
was to lock the city-gates, and keep the keys while they
remained closed, and also to be on guard during the day at
the gate-houses. The Aetolians accordingly waited for this
period of closing the gates, ready to make the attempt, and
provided with ladders; while the Polemarchs of the exiles,
having assassinated their colleagues on guard at the gate-house,
opened the gate. Some of the Aetolians, therefore, got into
the town by it, while others applied their ladders to the walls,
and mounting by their means, took forcible possession of them.
The inhabitants of the town, panic-stricken at the occurrence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
could not tell which way to turn. They could not give their
undivided energies to opposing the party which was forcing
its way through the gate, because of those who were attacking
them at the walls; nor could they defend the walls owing to the
enemies that were pouring through the gate. The Aetolians
having thus become rapidly masters of the town, in spite of the
injustice of the whole proceeding, did one act of supreme
justice. For the very men who had invited them, and betrayed
the town to them, they massacred before any one else, and
plundered their property. They then treated all the others of
the party in the same way; and, finally, taking up their
quarters in the houses, they systematically robbed them of all
valuables, and in many cases put Cynaethans to the rack, if
they suspected them of having anything concealed, whether
money, or furniture, or anything else of unusual value.</p>

<p>After inflicting this ruin on the Cynaethans they departed,
leaving a garrison to guard the walls, and marched towards Lusi.
Arrived at the temple of Artemis, which lies between Cleitor
and Cynaetha, and is regarded as inviolable by the Greeks,
they threatened to plunder the cattle of the goddess and the
other property round the temple. But the people of Lusi
acted with great prudence: they gave the Aetolians some of
the sacred furniture, and appealed to them not to commit
the impiety of inflicting any outrage. The gift was accepted,
and the Aetolians at once removed to Cleitor and pitched
their camp under its walls.</p>

<p><a name="b4_19" id="b4_19"><b>19.</b></a> Meanwhile Aratus, the Achaean Strategus, had despatched
an appeal for help to Philip; <span class="sidenote">Measures taken
by Aratus.</span>
was
collecting the men selected for service; and was
sending for the troops, arranged for by virtue of
the treaty, from Sparta and Messenia.</p>

<p>The Aetolians at first urged the people of Cleitor to abandon
their alliance with the Achaeans and adopt one
with themselves; <span class="sidenote">The Aetolians at

fail at Cleitor.</span>
and upon the Cleitorians
absolutely refusing, they began an assault upon
the town, and endeavoured to take it by an
escalade. But meeting with a bold and determined resistance
from the inhabitants, they desisted from the attempt; and
breaking up their camp marched back to Cynaetha, driving off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
with them on their route the cattle of the goddess. They at
first offered the city to the Eleans, but upon their refusing to
accept it, they determined to keep the town in their own
hands, <span class="sidenote">They burn
Cynaetha and
return home.</span>
and appointed Euripides to command
it: but subsequently, on the alarm of an army
of relief coming from Macedonia, they set fire
to the town and abandoned it, directing their march to
Rhium with the purpose of there taking ship and crossing
home. But when Taurion heard of the Aetolian
invasion, <span class="sidenote">Demetrius of
Pharos.</span>
and what had taken place at Cynaetha,
and saw that Demetrius of Pharos had sailed
into Cenchreae from his island expedition, he urged the latter
to assist the Achaeans, and dragging his galleys across the
Isthmus to attack the Aetolians as they crossed the gulf.
Now though Demetrius had enriched himself by his island
expedition, he had had to beat an ignominious retreat, owing to
the Rhodians putting out to sea to attack him: he was therefore
glad to accede to the request of Taurion, as the latter undertook
the expense of having his galleys dragged across the
Isthmus.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> He accordingly got them across, and arriving two
days after the passage of the Aetolians, plundered some places
on the seaboard of Aetolia and then returned to Corinth.</p>

<p>The Lacedaemonians had dishonourably failed to send the
full complement of men to which they were <span class="sidenote">Treason of the
Spartans.</span>
bound by their engagement, but had despatched
a small contingent only of horse and foot, to
save appearances.</p>

<p>Aratus however, having his Achaean troops, behaved in this
instance also with the caution of a statesman, <span class="sidenote">Inactivity of
Aratus.</span>
rather than the promptness of a general: for
remembering his previous failure he remained
inactively watching events, until Scopas and Dorimachus had
accomplished all they wanted and were safe home again;
although they had marched through a line of country which
was quite open to attack, full of defiles, and wanting only a
trumpeter<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> to sound a call to arms. But the great disaster
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>and misfortunes endured by the Cynaethans at the hands
of the Aetolians were looked upon as most richly deserved by
them.</p>

<p><a name="b4_20" id="b4_20"><b>20.</b></a> Now, seeing that the Arcadians as a whole have a
reputation for virtue throughout Greece, <span class="sidenote">The reasons of
the barbarity of
the Cynaethans.
Their neglect of
the refining
influences of
music, which is
carefully encouraged
in the rest
of Arcadia.</span>
not
only in respect of their hospitality and humanity,
but especially for their scrupulous piety, it
seems worth while to investigate briefly the
barbarous character of the Cynaethans: and
inquire how it came about that, though indisputably
Arcadians in race, they at that time so
far surpassed the rest of Greece in cruelty and
contempt of law.</p>

<p>They seem then to me to be the first, and indeed the
only, Arcadians who have abandoned institutions nobly conceived
by their ancestors and admirably adapted to the
character of all the inhabitants of Arcadia. For music, and I
mean by that <i>true</i> music, which it is advantageous to every one
to practise, is obligatory with the Arcadians. For we must
not think, as Ephorus in a hasty sentence of his preface, wholly
unworthy of him, says, that music was introduced among mankind
for the purpose of deception and jugglery; nor must the
ancients Cretans and Spartans be supposed to have introduced
the pipe and rhythmic movement in war, instead of the
trumpet, without some reason; nor the early Arcadians to have
given music such a high place in their constitution, that not
only boys, but young men up to the age of thirty, are compelled
to practise it, though in other respects most simple and
primitive in their manner of life. Every one is familiarly
acquainted with the fact that the Arcadians are the only
people among whom boys are by the laws trained from infancy
to sing hymns and paeans, in which they celebrate in the
traditional fashion the heroes and gods of their particular
towns. They next learn the airs of Philoxenus and Timotheus,
and dance with great spirit to the pipers at the yearly Dionysia
in the theatres, the boys at the boys&#8217; festival, and the young men
at what is called the men&#8217;s festival. Similarly it is their universal
custom, at all festal gatherings and banquets, not to have
strangers to make the music, but to produce it themselves, calling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
on each other in turn for a song. They do not look upon it
as a disgrace to disclaim the possession of any other accomplishment:
but no one can disclaim the knowledge of how to
sing, because all are forced to learn, nor can they confess the
knowledge, and yet excuse themselves from practising it, because
that too among them is looked upon as disgraceful. Their
young men again practise a military step to the music of the
pipe and in regular order of battle, producing elaborate
dances, which they display to their fellow-citizens every year in
the theatres, at the public charge and expense.</p>

<p><a name="b4_21" id="b4_21"><b>21.</b></a> Now the object of the ancient Arcadians in introducing
these customs was not, as I think, the gratification
of luxury and extravagance. <span class="sidenote">The object of the
musical training
of the Arcadians.</span>
They
saw that Arcadia was a nation of workers;
that the life of the people was laborious and hard; and
that, as a natural consequence of the coldness and gloom
which were the prevailing features of a great part of the
country, the general character of the people was austere. For
we mortals have an irresistible tendency to yield to climatic
influences: and to this cause, and no other, may be traced
the great distinctions which prevail amongst us in character,
physical formation, and complexion, as well as in
most of our habits, varying with nationality or wide local
separation. And it was with a view of softening and tempering
this natural ruggedness and rusticity, that they not only introduced
the things which I have mentioned, but also the custom
of holding assemblies and frequently offering sacrifices, in both
of which women took part equally with men; and having mixed
dances of girls and boys and in fact did everything they
could to humanise their souls by the civilising and softening
influence of such culture. The people of Cynaetha entirely
neglected these things, although they needed them more than
any one else, because their climate and country is by far the
most unfavourable in all Arcadia; and on the contrary gave
their whole minds to mutual animosities and contentions. They
in consequence became finally so brutalised, that no Greek city
has ever witnessed a longer series of the most atrocious crimes.
I will give one instance of the ill fortune of Cynaetha in this
respect, and of the disapproval of such proceedings on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
part of the Arcadians at large. When the Cynaethans, after
their great massacre, sent an embassy to Sparta, every city
which the ambassadors entered on their road at once ordered
them by a herald to depart; while the Mantineans not only
did that, but after their departure regularly purified their city
and territory from the taint of blood, by carrying victims
round them both.</p>

<p>I have had three objects in saying thus much on this subject.
First, that the character of the Arcadians should not
suffer from the crimes of one city: secondly, that other
nations should not neglect music, from an idea that certain
Arcadians give an excessive and extravagant attention to it:
and, lastly, I speak for the sake of the Cynaethans themselves,
that, if ever God gives them better fortune, they may humanise
themselves by turning their attention to education, and especially
to music.</p>

<p><a name="b4_22" id="b4_22"><b>22.</b></a> To return from this digression. When the Aetolians
had reached their homes in safety after this raid <span class="sidenote">Philip V. comes
to Corinth.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
upon the
Peloponnese, Philip, coming to the aid of
the Achaeans with an army, arrived at Corinth.
Finding that he was too late, he sent despatches
to all the allies urging them to send deputies at once to
Corinth, to consult on the measures required for the
common safety. Meanwhile he himself marched towards
Tegea, being informed that the Lacedaemonians were in a
state of revolution, <span class="sidenote">Advances toward
Sparta.</span>
and were fallen to mutual
slaughter. For being accustomed to have a
king over them, and to be entirely submissive
to their rulers, their sudden enfranchisement by means of
Antigonus, and the absence of a king, produced a state
of civil war; because they all imagined themselves to be
on a footing of complete political equality. At first two of
the five Ephors kept their views to themselves; while the other
three threw in their lot with the Aetolians, because they were
convinced that the youth of Philip would prevent him as yet
from having a decisive influence in the Peloponnese. But when,
contrary to their expectations, the Aetolians retired quickly from
the Peloponnese, and Philip arrived still more quickly from
Macedonia, the three Ephors became distrustful of Adeimantus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
one of the other two, because he was privy to and disapproved
of their plans; and were in a great state of anxiety lest he
should tell Philip everything as soon as that monarch approached.
After some consultation therefore with certain
young men, <span class="sidenote">Adeimantus
assassinated.</span>
they published a proclamation ordering all citizens
of military age to assemble in arms in the
sacred enclosure of Athene of the Brazen-house,
on the pretext that the Macedonians
were advancing against the town. This startling announcement
caused a rapid muster: when Adeimantus, who disapproved
of the measure, came forward and endeavoured to
show that &#8220;the proclamation and summons to assemble in arms
should have been made some time before, when they were
told that their enemies the Aetolians were approaching the
frontier: not then, when they learnt that their benefactors and
preservers the Macedonians were coming with their king.&#8221; In
the middle of this dissuasive speech the young men whose
co-operation had been secured struck him dead, and with him
Sthenelaus, Alcamenes, Thyestes, Bionidas, and several other
citizens; whereupon Polyphontes and certain of his party,
seeing clearly what was going to happen, went off to join
Philip.</p>

<p><a name="b4_23" id="b4_23"><b>23.</b></a> Immediately after the commission of this crime, the
Ephors who were then in power sent men
to Philip, <span class="sidenote">Philip summons
Spartan deputies
to Tegea.</span>
to accuse the victims of this
massacre; and to beg him to delay his
approach, until the affairs of the city had returned to their
normal state after this commotion; and to be assured meanwhile
that it was their purpose to be loyal and friendly to the
Macedonians in every respect. These ambassadors found
Philip near Mount Parthenius,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> and communicated to him
their commission. Having listened, he bade the ambassadors
make all haste home, and inform the Ephors that he was going
to continue his march to Tegea, and expected that they would
as quickly as possible send him men of credit to consult with
him on the present position of affairs. After hearing this
message from the king, the Lacedaemonian officers despatched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>ten commissioners headed by Omias to meet Philip; who,
on arriving at Tegea, and entering the king&#8217;s council chamber,
accused Adeimantus of being the cause of the late commotion;
and promised that they would perform all their
obligations as allies to Philip, and show that they were second
to none of those whom he looked upon as his most loyal
friends, in their affection for his person. With these and
similar asseverations the Lacedaemonian commissioners left
the council chamber. The members of the council were
divided in opinion: one party knowing the secret treachery of
the Spartan magistrates, and feeling certain that Adeimantus
had lost his life from his loyalty to Macedonia, while the Lacedaemonians
had really determined upon an alliance with the
Aetolians, advised Philip to make an example of the Lacedaemonians,
by treating them precisely as Alexander had treated
the Thebans, immediately after his assumption of his sovereignty.
But another party, consisting of the older counsellors,
sought to show that such severity was too great for the occasion,
and that all that ought to be done was to rebuke the
offenders, depose them, and put the management of the state
and the chief offices in the hands of his own friends.</p>

<p><a name="b4_24" id="b4_24"><b>24.</b></a> The king gave the final decision, if that decision may
be called the king&#8217;s: for it is not reasonable <span class="sidenote">The king decides
not to chastise
Sparta.</span>
to suppose that a mere boy should be
able to come to a decision on matters of such
moment. Historians, however, must attribute to the highest
official present the final decisions arrived at: it being
thoroughly understood among their readers that propositions
and opinions, such as these, in all probability proceed from the
members of the council, and particularly from those highest
in his confidence. In this case the decision of the king ought
most probably to be attributed to Aratus. It was to this
effect: the king said that &#8220;in the case of injuries inflicted by
the allies upon each other separately, his intervention ought
to be confined to a remonstrance by word of mouth or
letter; but that it was only injuries affecting the whole
body of the allies which demanded joint intervention and
redress: and seeing that the Lacedaemonians had plainly
committed no such injury against the whole body of allies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
but professed their readiness to satisfy every claim that could
with justice be made upon them, he held that he ought not
to decree any measure of excessive severity against them.
For it would be very inconsistent for him to take severe
measures against them for so insignificant a cause; while his
father inflicted no punishment at all upon them, though when
he conquered them they were not allies but professed enemies.&#8221;
It having, therefore, been formally decided to overlook the
incident, the king immediately sent Petraeus, one of his most
trusted friends, with Omias, to exhort the people to remain
faithful to their friendship with him and Macedonia, and to
interchange oaths of alliance; while he himself started once
more with his army and returned towards Corinth, having in
his conduct to the Lacedaemonians given an excellent specimen
of his policy towards the allies.</p>

<p><a name="b4_25" id="b4_25"><b>25.</b></a> When he arrived at Corinth he found the envoys from
the allied cities already there; and in consultation <span class="sidenote">The congress of
allies at Corinth

against the
Aetolians.</span>
with them he discussed the measures to
be taken in regard to the Aetolians. The complaints
against them were stated by the various
envoys. The Boeotians accused them of
plundering the temple of Athene at Itone<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> in time of peace:
the Phocians of having attacked and attempted to seize the
cities of Ambrysus and Daulium: the Epirotes of having committed
depredations in their territory. The Acarnanians
showed how they had contrived a plot for the betrayal of
Thyrium into their hands, and had gone so far as to actually
assault it under cover of night. The Achaeans made a statement
showing that they had seized Clarium in the territory of
Megalopolis; traversed the territories of Patrae and Pharae,
pillaging the country as they went; completely sacked
Cynaetha; plundered the temple of Artemis in Lusi; laid
siege to Cleitor; attempted Pylus by sea, and Megalopolis by
land, doing all they could by aid of the Illyrians to lay waste
the latter after its recent restoration. After listening to these
depositions, the congress of allies unanimously decided to go
to war with the Aetolians. A decree was, therefore, formulated
in which the aforesaid causes for war were stated as a preamble,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>and a declaration sub-joined of their intention of restoring to
the several allies any portion of their territory seized by the
Aetolians since the death of Demetrius, father of Philip; and
similarly of restoring to their ancestral forms of government
all states that had been compelled against their will to join the
Aetolian league; with full possession of their own territory and
cities; subject to no foreign garrison or tribute; in complete
independence; and in enjoyment of their own constitutions and
laws. Finally a clause in the decree declared their intention
of assisting the Amphictyonic council to restore the laws, and
to recover its control of the Delphic temple, wrested from it
by the Aetolians, who were determined to keep in their own
hands all that belonged to that temple.</p>

<p><a name="b4_26" id="b4_26"><b>26.</b></a> This decree was made in the first year of the
140th Olympiad, and with it began the so-called
Social war, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
the commencement of
which was thoroughly justifiable and a natural consequence
of the injurious acts of the Aetolians. The first step of the
congress was to send commissioners at once to the several
allies, that the decree having been confirmed by as many as
possible, all might join in this national war. Philip also sent
a declaratory letter to the Aetolians, in order that, if they had
any justification to put forward on the points alleged against
them, they might even at that late hour meet and settle the
controversy by conference: &#8220;but if they supposed that they
were, with no public declaration of war, to sack and plunder,
without the injured parties retaliating, on pain of being considered,
if they did so, to have commenced hostilities, they
were the most simple people in the world.&#8221; On the receipt
of this letter the Aetolian magistrates, thinking that Philip
would never come, named a day on which they would meet
him at Rhium. When they were informed, however, that he
had actually arrived there, they sent a despatch informing him
that they were not competent, before the meeting of the
Aetolian assembly, to settle any public matter on their own
authority. But when the Achaeans met at the usual federal
assembly, they ratified the decree, and published a proclamation
authorising reprisals upon the Aetolians. And when King
Philip appeared before the council at Aegium, and informed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
them at length of all that had taken place, they received
his speech with warmth, and formally renewed <span class="sidenote">Autumn, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
220.</span>
with him personally the friendship which had
existed between his ancestors and themselves.</p>

<p><a name="b4_27" id="b4_27"><b>27.</b></a> Meanwhile, the time of the annual election having
come round, the Aetolians elected Scopas as
their Strategus, <span class="sidenote">Scopas elected
Aetolian
Strategus.</span>
the man who had been the
moving spirit in all these acts of violence. I
am at a loss for fitting terms to describe such a public
policy. To pass a decree against going to war,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> and yet to go
on an actual expedition in force and pillage their neighbours&#8217;
territories: not to punish one of those responsible for this: but
on the contrary to elect as Strategi and bestow honours on the
leaders in these transactions,&mdash;this seems to me to involve the
grossest disingenuousness. I can find no word which better
describes such a treacherous policy; and I will quote two instances
to show what I mean by it. When Phoebidas treacherously
seized the Cadmeia, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;382.</span>the Lacedaemonians
fined the guilty general but declined to withdraw
the garrison, on the ground that the wrong was fully
atoned for by the punishment of the perpetrator of it: though
their plain duty was to have done the reverse, for it was the
latter which was of importance to the Thebans. Again this
same people published a proclamation giving the various
cities freedom and autonomy in accordance <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;387.</span>
with the terms of the peace of Antalcidas, and
yet did not withdraw their Harmosts from the cities. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;385.</span>
Again,
having driven the Mantineans from their
home, who were at the time their friends
and allies, they denied that they were doing any wrong,
inasmuch as they removed them from one city and settled
them in several. But indeed a man is a fool, as much as a
knave, if he imagines that, because he shuts his own eyes,
his neighbours cannot see. Their fondness for such tortuous
policy proved however, both to the Lacedaemonians and
Aetolians, the source of the greatest disasters; and it is not
one which should commend itself to the imitation either of
individuals or states, if they are well advised.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>
<p>King Philip, then, after his interview with the Achaean
assembly, started with his army on the way to Macedonia, in
all haste to make preparations for war; leaving a pleasant impression
in the minds of all the Greeks: for the nature of the
decree, which I have mentioned as having been passed by him,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
gave them good hopes of finding him a man of moderate
temper and royal magnanimity.</p>

<p><a name="b4_28" id="b4_28"><b>28.</b></a> These transactions were contemporaneous with Hannibal&#8217;s
expedition against Saguntum, after his conquest of all
Iberia south of the Iber. Now, had the first attempts of
Hannibal been from the beginning involved with the transactions
in Greece, it would have been plainly my proper course
to have narrated the latter side by side with those in Iberia in
my previous book, with an eye solely to dates. But seeing
that the wars in Italy, Greece, and Asia were at their commencements
entirely distinct, and yet became finally involved
with each other, I decided that my history of them must also
be distinct, until I came to the point at which they became
inseparably interlaced, and began to tend towards a common
conclusion. Thus both will be made clear,&mdash;the account of their
several commencements: and the time, manner, and causes
which led to the complication and amalgamation, of which I
spoke in my introduction. This point having been reached,
I must thenceforth embrace them all in one uninterrupted
narrative. This amalgamation began towards the end of the
war, in the third year of the 140th Olympiad. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;118.</span>
From that year,
therefore, my history will, with a due regard to
dates, become a general one. Before that
year it must be divided into distinct narratives, with a mere
recapitulation in each case of the events detailed in the preceding
book, introduced for the sake of facilitating the comprehension,
and rousing the admiration, of my readers.</p>

<p><a name="b4_29" id="b4_29"><b>29.</b></a> Philip then passed the winter in Macedonia, in an
energetic enlistment of troops for the coming
campaign, <span class="sidenote">Philip secures
the support of
Scerdilaidas.</span>
and in securing his frontier on the
side of the Barbarians. And having accomplished
these objects, he met Scerdilaidas and put himself
fearlessly in his power, and discussed with him the terms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>of friendship and alliance; and partly by promising to help
him in securing his power in Illyria, and partly by bringing
against the Aetolians the charges to which they were only
too open, persuaded him without difficulty to assent to his
proposals. The fact is that public crimes do not differ from
private, except in quantity and extent; and just as in the case
of petty thieves, what brings them to ruin more than anything
else is that they cheat and are unfaithful to each other, so
was it in the case of the Aetolians. They had agreed with
Scerdilaidas to give him half the booty, if he would join them
in their attack upon Achaea; but when, on his consenting to do
so, and actually carrying out his engagement, they had sacked
Cynaetha and carried off a large booty in slaves and cattle,
they gave him no share in the spoil at all. He was therefore
already enraged with them; and required very little persuasion
on Philip&#8217;s part to induce him to accept the proposal,
and agree to join the alliance, on condition of receiving a
yearly subsidy of twenty talents; and, in return, putting to
sea with thirty galleys and carrying on a naval war with the
Aetolians.</p>

<p><a name="b4_30" id="b4_30"><b>30.</b></a> While Philip was thus engaged, the commissioners sent
out to the allies were performing their mission. <span class="sidenote">The Acarnanians,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
The first place they came to was Acarnania;
and the Acarnanians, with a noble promptitude,
confirmed the decree and undertook to join the war against
the Aetolians with their full forces. And yet they, if any
one, might have been excused if they had put the matter
off, and hesitated, and shown fear of entering upon a
war with their neighbours; both because they lived upon the
frontiers of Aetolia, and still more because they were peculiarly
open to attack, and, most of all, because they had a short
time before experienced the most dreadful disasters from the
enmity of the Aetolians. But I imagine that men of noble
nature, whether in private or public affairs, look upon duty as
the highest consideration; and in adherence to this principle
no people in Greece have been more frequently conspicuous
than the Acarnanians, although the forces at their command
were but slender. With them, above all others in Greece, an
alliance should be sought at a crisis, without any misgiving;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
for they have, individually and collectively, an element of
stability and a spirit of liberality. The conduct of the Epirotes
was in strong contrast. <span class="sidenote">Duplicity of
the Epirotes.</span>When they
heard what the commissioners had to say,
indeed, they, like the Acarnanians, joined in
confirming the decree, and voted to go to war with the
Aetolians at such time as Philip also did the same; but
with ignoble duplicity they told the Aetolian envoys that they
had determined to maintain peace with them.</p>

<p>Ambassadors were despatched also to King Ptolemy, to
urge him not to send money to the Aetolians, <span class="sidenote">Ptolemy Philopator.</span>
nor to supply them with any aid against Philip
and the allies.</p>

<p><a name="b4_31" id="b4_31"><b>31.</b></a> The Messenians again, on whose account the war began,
answered the commissioners sent to
them that, <span class="sidenote">Timidity of the
Messenians.</span>
seeing Phigalia was on their
frontier and was in the power of the Aetolians,
they would not undertake the war until that city was
wrested from them. This decision was forcibly carried,
much against the will of the people at large, by the Ephors
Oenis and Nicippus, and some others of the oligarchical party:
wherein they showed, to my thinking, great ignorance of their
true interests. I admit, indeed, that war is a terrible thing;
but it is less terrible than to submit to anything whatever in
order to avoid it. For what is the meaning of our fine talk
about equality of rights, freedom of speech, and liberty, if the
one important thing is peace? We have no good word for

<div class="line i1">That brings no shame.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For though his advice was for the moment acceptable, it was
not long before it became manifest that his opinion was as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>mischievous as it was dishonourable. For peace, with justice
and honour, is the noblest and most advantageous thing in
the world; when joined with disgrace and contemptible
cowardice, it is the basest and most disastrous.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p><a name="b4_32" id="b4_32"><b>32.</b></a> The Messenian leaders, then, being of oligarchical
tendencies, and aiming at their own immediate advantage, were
always too much inclined to peace. On many critical occasions
indeed they managed to elude fear and danger: but all the while
this policy of theirs was accumulating a heavy retribution for
themselves; and they finally involved their country in the
gravest misfortunes. And the reason in my opinion was this,
that being neighbours to two of the most powerful nations in
the Peloponnese, or I might almost say in Greece, I mean the
Arcadians and Lacedaemonians,&mdash;one of which had been
irreconcilably hostile to them from the moment they occupied
the country, and the other disposed to be friendly and protect
them,&mdash;they never frankly accepted hostility to the Spartans, or
friendship with the Arcadians. Accordingly when the attention
of the former was distracted by domestic or foreign war, the
Messenians were secure; for they always enjoyed peace and
tranquillity from the fact of their country lying out of the road:
but when the Lacedaemonians, having nothing else on hand
to distract their attention, took to inflicting injuries on them,
they were unable to withstand the superior strength of the
Lacedaemonians by their own power; and, having failed to
secure the support of their true friends, who were ready to do
anything for their protection, they were reduced to the alternatives
of becoming the slaves of Sparta and enduring her
heavy exactions; or of leaving their homes to escape from this
servitude, abandoning their country with wives and children.
And this has repeatedly happened to them within comparatively
recent times.</p>

<p>That the present settlement of the Peloponnese may prove a
lasting one, so that no measure such as I am about to describe
may be ever necessary, is indeed my earnest wish: but if anything
does happen to disturb it, and threaten revolutionary
changes, the only hope for the Messenians and Megalopolitans
of continuing to occupy their present territory, that I can see,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>is a recurrence to the policy of Epaminondas. They must
resolve, that is to say, upon a cordial and sincere partnership
with each other in every danger and labour.</p>

<p><a name="b4_33" id="b4_33"><b>33.</b></a> And perhaps my observation may receive some
support from ancient history. For, among many other indications,
it is a fact that the Messenians did set up a pillar
close to the altar of Zeus Lycaeus in the time of Aristomenes,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>
according to the evidence of Callisthenes, in which they inscribed
the following verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">A faithless king will perish soon or late!</div>
<div class="line i1">Messene tracked him down right easily,</div>
<div class="line">The traitor:&mdash;perjury must meet its fate;</div>
<div class="line i1">Glory to Zeus, and life to Arcady!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The point of this is, that, having lost their own country, they
pray the gods to save Arcadia as their second country.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
And it was very natural that they should do so; for not only did
the Arcadians receive them when driven from their own land,
at the time of the Aristomenic war, and make them welcome
to their homes and free of their civic rights; but they also
passed a vote bestowing their daughters in marriage upon those
of the Messenians who were of proper age; and besides all
this, investigated the treason of their king Aristocrates in the
battle of the Trench; and, finding him guilty, put him to death
and utterly destroyed his whole family. But setting aside
these ancient events, what has happened recently after the
restoration of Megalopolis and Messene will be sufficient to
support what I have said. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;362.</span>For when, upon
the death of Epaminondas leaving the result
of the battle of Mantinea doubtful, the Lacedaemonians
endeavoured to prevent the Messenians from being included
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>in the truce, hoping even then to get Messenia into their
own hands, the Megalopolitans, and all the other Arcadians
who were allied with the Messenians, made such a point of
their being admitted to the benefits of the new confederacy,
that they were accepted by the allies and allowed to take the
oaths and share in the provisions of the peace; while the
Lacedaemonians were the only Greeks excluded from the
treaty. With such facts before him, could any one doubt the
soundness of the suggestion I lately made?</p>

<p>I have said thus much for the sake of the Arcadians and
Messenians themselves; that, remembering all the misfortunes
which have befallen their countries at the hands of the
Lacedaemonians, they may cling close to the policy of mutual
affection and fidelity; and let no fear of war, or desire of peace,
induce them to abandon each other in what affects the highest
interests of both.</p>

<p><a name="b4_34" id="b4_34"><b>34.</b></a> In the matter of the commissioners from the allies, to
go back to my story, the behaviour of the
Lacedaemonians was very characteristic. <span class="sidenote">Division of opinion
in Sparta,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
For
their own ill-considered and tortuous policy
had placed them in such a difficulty, that they finally dismissed
them without an answer: thus illustrating, as it
seems to me, the truth of the saying, that, &#8220;boldness pushed
to extremes amounts to want of sense, and comes to nothing.&#8221;
Subsequently, however, on the appointment of new Ephors, the
party who had originally promoted the outbreak, and had been
the causes of the massacre, sent to the Aetolians to induce them
to despatch an ambassador to Sparta. The Aetolians gladly
consented, and in a short time Machatas arrived there in that
capacity. Pressure was at once put upon the Ephors to
allow Machatas to address the people,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> and to re-establish
royalty in accordance with the ancient constitution, and not to
allow the Heraclid dynasty to be any longer suppressed, contrary
to the laws. The Ephors were annoyed at the proposal, but
were unable to withstand the pressure, and afraid of a rising
of the younger men: they therefore answered that the question
of restoring the kings must be reserved for future consideration;
but they consented to grant Machatas an opportunity of addressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
a public assembly. When the people accordingly were met,
Machatas came forward, and in a long speech urged them to
embrace the alliance with Aetolia; inveighing in reckless and
audacious terms against the Macedonians, while he went
beyond all reason and truth in his commendations of the
Aetolians. Upon his retirement, there was a long and animated
debate between those who supported the Aetolians and
advised the adoption of their alliance, and those who took the
opposite side. When, however, some of the elders reminded
the people of the good services rendered them by Antigonus
and the Macedonians, and the injuries inflicted on them by
Charixenus and Timaeus,&mdash;when the Aetolians invaded them
with their full force and ravaged their territory, enslaved the
neighbouring villages, and laid a plot for attacking Sparta
itself by a fraudulent and forcible restoration of exiles,&mdash;these
words produced a great revulsion of feeling, and the people
finally decided to maintain the alliance with Philip and the
Macedonians. Machatas accordingly had to go home without
attaining the object of his mission.</p>

<p><a name="b4_35" id="b4_35"><b>35.</b></a> The party, however, at Sparta who were the original
of the instigators of the outbreak could not make up
their minds to give way. <span class="sidenote">Murder of the
Ephors,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
They once more therefore
determined to commit a crime of the most
impious description, having first corrupted some of the
younger men. It was an ancestral custom that, at a certain
sacrifice, all citizens of military age should join fully armed in
a procession to the temple of Athene of the Brazen-house,
while the Ephors remained in the sacred precinct and completed
the sacrifice. As the young men therefore were
conducting the procession, some of them suddenly fell upon
the Ephors, while they were engaged with the sacrifice, and
slew them. The enormity of this crime will be made apparent
by remembering that the sanctity of this temple was such, that
it gave a safe asylum even to criminals condemned to death;
whereas its privileges were now by the cruelty of these
audacious men treated with such contempt, that the whole of
the Ephors were butchered round the altar and the table of the
goddess. In pursuance of their purpose they next killed one
of the elders, Gyridas, and drove into exile those who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
spoken against the Aetolians. They then chose some of
their own body as Ephors, and made an alliance with the
Aetolians. Their motives for doing all this, for incurring the
enmity of the Achaeans, for their ingratitude to the Macedonians,
and generally for their unjustifiable conduct towards all, was
before everything else their devotion to Cleomenes, and the
hopes and expectations they continued to cherish that he
would return to Sparta in safety. So true it is that men who
have the tact to ingratiate themselves with those who
surround them can, even when far removed, leave in their
hearts very effective materials for kindling the flame of a
renewed popularity. This people for instance, to say nothing
of other examples, after nearly three years of constitutional
government, following the banishment of Cleomenes, without
once thinking of appointing kings at Sparta, no sooner heard
of the death of Cleomenes than they were eager&mdash;populace
and Ephors alike&mdash;to restore kingly rule. <span class="sidenote">Agesipolis appointed
king,</span>
Accordingly the Ephors who were in sympathy
with the conspirators, and who had
made the alliance with Aetolia which I just now mentioned, did
so. One of these kings so restored they appointed in accordance
with the regular and legal succession, namely Agesipolis.
He was a child at the time, a son of Agesipolis, and grandson of
that Cleombrotus who had become king, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;242.</span>as the
next of kin to this family, when Leonidas was
driven from office. As guardian of the young king they elected
Cleomenes, son of Cleombrotus and brother of Agesipolis.</p>

<p>Of the other royal house there were surviving two sons of
Archidamus, son of Eudamidas, by the daughter
of Hippodemon; <span class="sidenote">and Lycurgas.</span>
as well as Hippodemon himself,
the son of Agesilaus, and several other members of
the same branch, though somewhat less closely connected
than those I have mentioned. But these were all passed
over, and Lycurgus was appointed king, none of whose
ancestors had ever enjoyed that title. A present of a
talent to each of the Ephors made him &#8220;descendant of
Hercules&#8221; and king of Sparta. So true is it all the world
over that such nobility<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> is a mere question of a little money.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>
<p>The result was that the penalty for their folly had to be paid,
not by the third generation, but by the very authors of this
royalist restoration.</p>

<p><a name="b4_36" id="b4_36"><b>36.</b></a> When Machatas heard what had happened at Sparta,
he returned thither and urged the Ephors and
kings to go to war with the Achaeans; <span class="sidenote">Spartans attack

arguing
that that was the only way of stopping the ambition
of the party in Sparta who were doing
all they could to break up the alliance with the Aetolians, or
of the party in Aetolia who were co-operating with them.
Having obtained the consent of the Ephors and kings,
Machatas returned home with a success secured him by the
blindness of his partisans in Sparta; while Lycurgus with the
army and certain others of the citizens invaded the Argive
territory, the inhabitants being quite unprepared for an attack,
owing to the existing settlement. By a sudden assault he
seized Polichna, Prasiae, Leucae, and Cyphanta, but was
repulsed at Glympes and Zarax. After these achievements of
their king, the Lacedaemonians proclaimed a licence of reprisal
against the Achaeans. With the Eleans also Machatas
was successful in persuading them, by the same arguments as
he had used at Sparta, to go to war with the Achaeans.</p>

<p>The unexpected success of these intrigues caused the
Aetolians to enter upon the war with high spirits. But it was
quite the contrary with the Achaeans: for Philip, on whom
their hopes rested, was still busy with his preparations; the
Epirotes were hesitating about going to war, and the Messenians
were entirely passive; and meantime the Aetolians, aided
by the blind policy of the Eleans and Lacedaemonians, were
threatening them with actual war on every side.</p>

<p><a name="b4_38" id="b4_38"><b>38.</b></a> At the same time the Rhodians went to
war with the Byzantines, for reasons which I <span class="sidenote">Rhodian and

220-219 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></span>
must now describe.</p>

<p>As far as the sea is concerned, Byzantium occupies a position
the most secure and in every way the most <span class="sidenote">Advantages of
the situation of
Byzantium.</span>
advantageous of any town in our quarter of the
world: while in regard to the land, its situation
is in both respects the most unfavourable. By sea it so completely
commands the entrance to the Pontus, that no merchant
can sail in or out against its will. The Pontus therefore
being rich in what the rest of the world requires for the
support of life, the Byzantines are absolute masters of all such
things. For those commodities which are the first necessaries
of existence, cattle and slaves, are confessedly supplied by the
districts round the Pontus in greater profusion, and of better
quality, than by any others: and for luxuries, they supply us with
honey, wax, and salt-fish in great abundance; while they take
our superfluous stock of olive oil and every kind of wine. In the
matter of corn there is a mutual interchange, they supplying or
taking it as it happens to be convenient. Now the Greeks
would necessarily have been excluded entirely from traffic in
these articles, or at least would have had to carry it on at a
loss, if the Byzantines had adopted a hostile attitude, and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
common cause formerly with the Gauls, or still more at this
time with the Thracians, or had abandoned the place altogether:
for owing to the narrowness of the strait, and the number of
the barbarians along its shores, it would have become entirely
impassable to our ships. The Byzantines themselves probably
feel the advantages of the situation, in the supplies of the
necessaries of life, more than any one else; for their superfluity
finds a ready means of export, and what they lack is readily
imported, with profit to themselves, and without difficulty or
danger: but other people too, as I have said, get a great
many commodities by their means. As common benefactors
therefore of all Greece they might justly expect, not only
gratitude, but the united assistance of Greeks, when threatened
by the barbarians.</p>

<p>But since the peculiar natural advantages of this site are
generally unknown, because it lies somewhat outside the parts
of the world ordinarily visited; and since it is an universal
wish to be acquainted with things of this sort, by ocular
inspection, if possible, of such places as have any unusual
or remarkable features; or, if that is impossible, by having in
our minds some ideas or images of them as like the truth as
may be, I must now state the facts of the case, and what it
is that makes this city so eminently rich and prosperous.</p>

<p><a name="b4_39" id="b4_39"><b>39.</b></a> The sea called &#8220;The Pontus&#8221; has a circumference of
twenty-two thousand stades, and two mouths <span class="sidenote">The Pontus.</span>
diametrically opposite to each other, the one
opening into the Propontis and the other into the Maeotic
Lake; which latter also has itself a circumference of eight
thousand stades. Into these two basins many great rivers
discharge themselves on the Asiatic side, and still larger
and more numerous on the European; and so the
Maeotic lake, as it gets filled up, flows into the Pontus,
and the Pontus into the Propontis. The mouth of the
Maeotic lake is called the Cimmerian Bosporus, about
thirty stades broad and sixty long, and shallow all over; that
of the Pontus is called the Thracian Bosporus, and is a
hundred and twenty stades long, and of a varying breadth.
Between Calchedon and Byzantium the channel is fourteen
stades broad, and this is the entrance at the end nearest the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Propontis. Coming from the Pontus, it begins at a place
called Hieron, at which they say that Jason on his return
voyage from Colchis first sacrificed to the twelve gods. This
place is on the Asiatic side, and its distance from the European
coast is twelve stades, measuring to Sarapieium, which lies
exactly opposite in Thrace. There are two causes which account
for the fact that the waters, both of the Maeotic lake and the
Pontus, continually flow outwards. One is patent at once to
every observer, namely, that by the continual discharge of
many streams into basins which are of definite circumference and
content, the water necessarily is continually increasing in bulk,
and, had there been no outlet, would inevitably have encroached
more and more, and occupied an ever enlarging area in the
depression: but as outlets do exist, the surplus water is carried
off by a natural process, and runs perpetually through the
channels that are there to receive it. The second cause is the
alluvial soil brought down, in immense quantities of every
description, by the rivers swollen from heavy rains, which
forms shelving banks and continually forces the water to take
a higher level, which is thus also carried through these outlets.
Now as this process of alluvial deposit and influx of water is
unceasing and continuous, so also the discharge through the
channels is necessarily unceasing and continuous.</p>

<p>These are the true causes of the outflow of the Pontus,
which do not depend for their credit on the stories of
merchants, but upon the actual observation of nature, which is
the most accurate method discoverable.</p>

<p><a name="b4_40" id="b4_40"><b>40.</b></a> As I have started this topic I must not, as most
historians do, leave any point undiscussed, or only barely
stated. My object is rather to give information, and to clear
up doubtful points for my readers. This is the peculiarity of
the present day, in which every sea and land has been thrown
open to travellers; and in which, therefore, one can no longer
employ the evidence of poets and fabulists, as my predecessors
have done on very many points, &#8220;offering,&#8221; as Heraclitus says,
&#8220;tainted witnesses to disputed facts,&#8221;&mdash;but I must try to
make my narrative in itself carry conviction to my readers.</p>

<p>I say then the Pontus has long been in process of being
filled up with mud, and that this process is actually going on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
now: and further, that in process of time both it and the
Propontis, assuming the same local conditions to be maintained,
and the causes of the alluvial deposit to continue
active, will be entirely filled up. For time being infinite, and
the depressions most undoubtedly finite, it is plain that, even
though the amount of deposit be small, they must in course of
time be filled. For a finite process, whether of accretion or
decrease, must, if we presuppose infinite time, be eventually
completed, however infinitesimal its progressive stages may be.
In the present instance the amount of soil deposited being not
small, but exceedingly large, it is plain that the result I
mentioned will not be remote but rapid. And, in fact, it is
evident that it is already taking place. The Maeotic lake is
already so much choked up, that the greater part of it is only
from seven to five fathoms deep, and accordingly cannot any
longer be passed by large ships without a pilot. And having
moreover been originally a sea precisely on a level with the
Pontus, it is now a freshwater lake: the sea-water has been
expelled by the silting up of the bottom, and the discharge of
the rivers has entirely overpowered it. The same will happen
to the Pontus, and indeed is taking place at this moment; and
though it is not evident to ordinary observers, owing to the
vastness of its basin, yet a moderately attentive study will
discover even now what is going on.</p>

<p><a name="b4_41" id="b4_41"><b>41.</b></a> For the Danube discharging itself into the Pontus by
several mouths, we find opposite it a bank formed by the mud
discharged from these mouths extending for nearly a thousand
stades, at a distance of a day&#8217;s sail from the shore as it now exists;
upon which ships sailing to the Pontus run, while apparently still
in deep water, and find themselves unexpectedly stranded on
the sandbanks which the sailors call the Breasts. That this
deposit is not close to the shore, but projected to some distance,
must be accounted for thus: exactly as far as the currents of
the rivers retain their force from the strength of the descending
stream, and overpower that of the sea, it must of course follow
that to that distance the earth, and whatever else is carried
down by the rivers, would be projected, and neither settle nor
become fixed until it is reached. But when the force of the
currents has become quite spent by the depth and bulk of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
sea, it is but natural that the soil held in solution should settle
down and assume a fixed position. This is the explanation of
the fact, that, in the case of large and rapid rivers, such embankments
are at considerable distances, and the sea close in shore
deep; while in the case of smaller and more sluggish streams, these
sandbanks are at their mouths. The strongest proof of this is
furnished by the case of heavy rains; for when they occur,
rivers of inferior size, overpowering the waves at their mouths,
project the alluvial deposit out to sea, to a distance exactly in
proportion to the force of the streams thus discharging themselves.
It would be mere foolish scepticism to disbelieve in
the enormous size of this sandbank, and in the mass of stones,
timber, and earth carried down by the rivers; when we often see
with our own eyes an insignificant stream suddenly swell into
a torrent, and force its way over lofty rocks, sweeping along
with it every kind of timber, soil, and stones, and making such
huge moraines, that at times the appearance of a locality
becomes in a brief period difficult to recognise.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p><a name="b4_42" id="b4_42"><b>42.</b></a> This should prevent any surprise that rivers of such
magnitude and rapidity, flowing perpetually instead of intermittently,
should produce these effects and end by filling up
the Pontus. For it is not a mere probability, but a logical
certainty, that this must happen. And a proof of what is going
to take place is this, that in the same proportion as the
Maeotic lake is less salt than the Pontus, the Pontus is less
so than the Mediterranean. From which it is manifest that,
when the time which it has taken for the Maeotic lake to fill
up shall have been extended in proportion to the excess of the
Pontic over the Maeotic basin, then the Pontus will also
become like a marsh and lake, and filled with fresh water like
the Maeotic lake: nay, we must suppose that the process will
be somewhat more rapid, insomuch as the rivers falling into
it are more numerous and more rapid. I have said thus much
in answer to the incredulity of those who cannot believe that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>the Pontus is actually being silted up, and will some day be
filled; and that so vast a sea will ever become a lake or marsh.
But I have another and higher object also in thus speaking:
which is to prevent our ignorance from forcing us to give a
childish credence to every traveller&#8217;s tale and marvel related
by voyagers; and that, by possessing certain indications of the
truth, we may be enabled by them to test the truth or falsehood
of anything alleged by this or that person.</p>

<p><a name="b4_43" id="b4_43"><b>43.</b></a> I must now return to the discussion of the excellence
of the site of Byzantium. <span class="sidenote">Site of
Byzantium.</span>
The length of the
channel connecting the Pontus and Propontis
being, as I have said, a hundred and twenty
stades, and Hieron marking its termination towards the
Pontus, and the Strait of Byzantium that towards the Propontis,&mdash;half-way
between these, on the European side, stands Hermaeum,
on a headland jutting out into the channel, about
five stades from the Asiatic coast, just at the narrowest point
of the whole channel; <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;512.</span>
where Darius is said to
have made his bridge of ships across the strait,
when he crossed to invade Scythia. In the rest of the channel
the running of the current from the Pontus is much the same,
owing to the similarity of the coast formation on either side
of it; but when it reaches Hermaeum on the European side,
which I said was the narrowest point, the stream flowing from
the Pontus, and being thus confined, strikes the European coast
with great violence, and then, as though by a rebound from a
blow, dashes against the opposite Asiatic coast, and thence again
sweeps back and strikes the European shore near some headlands
called the Hearths: thence it runs rapidly once more to
the spot on the Asiatic side called the Cow, the place on
which the myth declares Io to have first stood after swimming
the channel. Finally the current runs from the Cow right up
to Byzantium, and dividing into two streams on either side of the
city, the lesser part of it forms the gulf called the Horn, while
the greater part swerves once more across. But it has no longer
sufficient way on it to reach the opposite shore on which Calchedon
stands: for after its several counter-blows the current, finding
at this point a wider channel, slackens; and no longer makes
short rebounds at right angles from one shore to the other, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
more and more at an obtuse angle, and accordingly, falling
short of Calchedon, runs down the middle of the channel.</p>

<p><a name="b4_44" id="b4_44"><b>44.</b></a> What then makes Byzantium a most excellent site, and
Calchedon the reverse, is just this: and although at first sight
both positions seem equally convenient, the practical fact is
that it is difficult to sail up to the latter, even if you wish to do
so; while the current carries you to the former, whether you
will or no, as I have just now shown. And a proof of my
assertion is this: those who want to cross from Calchedon to
Byzantium cannot sail straight across the channel, but coast up
to the Cow and Chrysopolis,&mdash;which the Athenians formerly
seized, by the advice of Alcibiades, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;410.</span>
when
they for the first time levied customs on
ships sailing into the Pontus,<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>&mdash;and then drift down
the current, which carries them as a matter of course to
Byzantium. And the same is the case with a voyage on
either side of Byzantium. For if a man is running before a
south wind from the Hellespont, or to the Hellespont from the
Pontus before the Etesian winds, if he keeps to the European
shore, he has a direct and easy course to the narrow part of the
Hellespont between Abydos and Sestos, and thence also back
again to Byzantium: but if he goes from Calchedon along the
Asiatic coast, the case is exactly the reverse, from the fact that
the coast is broken up by deep bays, and that the territory of
Cyzicus projects to a considerable distance. Nor can a man
coming from the Hellespont to Calchedon obviate this by
keeping to the European coast as far as Byzantium, and then
striking across to Calchedon; for the current and other circumstances
which I have mentioned make it difficult. Similarly,
for one sailing out from Calchedon it is absolutely impossible
to make straight for Thrace, owing to the intervening
current, and to the fact that both winds are unfavourable
to both voyages; for as the south wind blows into the
Pontus, and the north wind from it, the one or the other of
these must be encountered in both these voyages. These,
then, are the advantages enjoyed by Byzantium in regard to
the sea: I must now describe its disadvantages on shore.</p>

<p><a name="b4_45" id="b4_45"><b>45.</b></a> They consist in the fact that its territory is so completely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
hemmed in by Thrace from shore to shore, that the
Byzantines have a perpetual and dangerous
war continually on hand with the Thracians. <span class="sidenote">Disadvantages of
Byzantium.</span>
For they are unable once for all to arm and
repel them by a single decisive battle, owing to the number
of their people and chiefs. For if they conquer one chief,
three others still more formidable invade their territory. Nor
again do they gain anything by consenting to pay tribute
and make terms; for a concession of any sort to one brings at
once five times as many enemies upon them. Therefore, as I
say, they are burdened by a perpetual and dangerous war: for
what can be more hazardous or more formidable than a war
with barbarians living on your borders? Nay, it is not only
this perpetual struggle with danger on land, but, apart from the
evils that always accompany war, they have to endure a misery
like that ascribed by the poets to Tantalus: for being in
possession of an extremely fertile district, no sooner have
they expended their labour upon it and been rewarded by
crops of the finest quality, than the barbarians sweep down,
and either destroy them, or collect and carry them off; and
then, to say nothing of the loss of their labour and expense,
the very excellence of the crops enhances the misery and
distress of seeing them destroyed before their eyes. Still,
habit making them able to endure the war with the Thracians,
they maintained their original connexions with the other
Greeks; but when to their other misfortunes was added the
attack of the Gauls under Comontorius, they were reduced to
a sad state of distress indeed.</p>

<p><a name="b4_46" id="b4_46"><b>46.</b></a> These Gauls had left their country with Brennus, and
having survived the battle at Delphi and made
their way to the Hellespont, <span class="sidenote">The Gauls,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;279.</span>
instead of crossing
to Asia, were captivated by the beauty
of the district round Byzantium, and settled there. Then,
having conquered the Thracians and erected Tyle<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> into
a capital, they placed the Byzantines in extreme danger. In
their earlier attacks, made under the command of Comontorius
their first king, the Byzantines always bought them off by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>presents amounting to three, or five, or sometimes even ten
thousand gold pieces, on condition of their not devastating
their territory: and at last were compelled to agree to pay
them a yearly tribute of eighty talents, until the time of Cavarus,
in whose reign their kingdom came to an end; and their whole
tribe, being in their turn conquered by the Thracians, were
entirely annihilated. It was in these times, then, that being
hard pressed by the payment of these exactions, the Byzantines
first sent embassies to the Greek states with a prayer for aid
and support in their dangerous situation: but being disregarded
by the greater number, they, under pressure of
necessity, attempted to levy dues upon ships sailing into the
Pontus.</p>

<p><a name="b4_47" id="b4_47"><b>47.</b></a> Now this exaction by the Byzantines of a duty upon
goods brought from the Pontus, <span class="sidenote">The Byzantines
levy a toll.</span>
being a
heavy loss and burden to everybody, was
universally regarded as a grievance; and accordingly
an appeal from all those engaged in the trade was
made to the Rhodians, as acknowledged masters of the sea:
and it was from this circumstance that the war originated of
which I am about to speak.</p>

<p>For the Rhodians, roused to action by the loss incurred
by themselves, as well as that of their
neighbours, <span class="sidenote">The Rhodians
declare war,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
at first joined their allies in an
embassy to Byzantium, and demanded the
abolition of the impost. The Byzantines refused compliance,
being persuaded that they were in the right by the
arguments advanced by their chief magistrates, Hecatorus and
Olympidorus, in their interview with the ambassadors. The
Rhodian envoys accordingly departed without effecting their
object. But upon their return home, war was at once voted
against Byzantium on these grounds; and messengers were
immediately despatched to Prusias inviting his co-operation in
the war: for they knew that Prusias was from various causes
incensed with the Byzantines.</p>

<p><a name="b4_48" id="b4_48"><b>48.</b></a> The Byzantines took steps of a similar nature, by
sending to Attalus and Achaeus begging for their assistance.
For his part Attalus was ready enough to give it: but his
importance was small, because he had been reduced within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
limits of his ancestral dominions by Achaeus. But Achaeus
who exercised dominion throughout Asia on this side Taurus,
and had recently established his regal power, promised assistance;
and his attitude roused high hopes in the minds of the
Byzantines, and corresponding depression in those of the Rhodians
and Prusias. <span class="sidenote">Achaeus.</span>
Achaeus was a relation of
the Antiochus who had just succeeded to the
kingdom of Syria; and he became possessed of the dominion
I have mentioned through the following circumstances.
After the death of Seleucus, father of the above-named
Antiochus, and the succession of his eldest son
Seleucus to the throne, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;226.</span>
Achaeus accompanied
the latter in an expedition over Mount Taurus, about two years
before the period of which we are speaking.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> For as soon as
Seleucus the younger had succeeded to the kingdom he learnt
that Attalus had already reduced all Asia on this side of Taurus
under his power; and being accordingly eager to support his
own rights, he crossed Taurus with a large army. There he
was treacherously assassinated by Apaturius the Gaul, and
Nicanor. Achaeus, in right of his relationship, promptly
revenged his murder by killing Nicanor and Apaturius; and
taking supreme command of the army and administration,
conducted it with wisdom and integrity. For the opportunity
was a convenient one, and the feeling of the common soldiers
was all in favour of his assuming the crown; yet he refused to
do so, and preserving the royal title for Antiochus the younger,
son of Seleucus, went on energetically with the expedition, and
the recovery of the whole of the territory this side Taurus.
Meeting however with unexpected success,&mdash;for he shut up
Attalus within the walls of Pergamus and became master of all
the rest of the country,&mdash;he was puffed up by his good fortune,
and at once swerved from his straightforward course of policy.
He assumed the diadem, adopted the title of king, and was at
this time the most powerful and formidable of all the kings
and princes this side Taurus. This was the man on whose
help the Byzantines relied when they undertook the war
against the Rhodians and Prusias.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b4_49" id="b4_49"><b>49.</b></a> As to the provocations given before this to Prusias by
the Byzantines they were various. <span class="sidenote">Prusias.</span>
In the first
place he complained that, having voted to put
up certain statues of him, they had not done so, but had
delayed or forgotten it. In the second place he was
annoyed with them for taking great pains to compose the
hostility, and put an end to the war, between Achaeus and
Attalus; because he looked upon a friendship between these
two as in many ways detrimental to his own interests. He
was provoked also because it appeared that when Attalus was
keeping the festival of Athene, the Byzantines had sent a
mission to join in the celebration; but had sent no one to him
when he was celebrating the Soteria. Nursing therefore a
secret resentment for these various offences, he gladly snatched
at the pretext offered him by the Rhodians; and arranged with
their ambassadors that they were to carry on the war by sea,
while he would undertake to inflict no less damage on the
enemy by land.</p>

<p>Such were the causes and origin of the war between
Rhodes and Byzantium.</p>

<p><a name="b4_50" id="b4_50"><b>50.</b></a> At first the Byzantines entered upon the war with
energy, in full confidence of receiving the
assistance of Achaeus; <span class="sidenote">Hostilities
commence,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
and of being able
to cause Prusias as much alarm and danger
by fetching Tiboetes from Macedonia as he had done
to them. For Prusias, entering upon the war with all the
animosity which I have described, had seized the place called
Hieron at the entrance of the channel, which the Byzantines
not long before had purchased for a considerable sum of
money, because of its convenient situation; and because they
did not wish to leave in any one else&#8217;s hands a point of vantage
to be used against merchants sailing into the Pontus, or one
which commanded the slave trade, or the fishing. Besides
this, Prusias had seized in Asia a district of Mysia, which had
been in the possession of Byzantium for many years past.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Rhodians manned six ships and received
four from their allies; and, having elected Xenophantus to
command them, they sailed with this squadron of ten ships
to the Hellespont. Nine of them dropped anchor near Sestos,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
and stopped ships sailing into the Pontus; with the tenth the
admiral sailed to Byzantium, to test the spirit of the people, and
see whether they were already sufficiently alarmed to change
their minds about the war. Finding them resolved not to
listen he sailed away, and, taking up his other nine ships,
returned to Rhodes with the whole squadron.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Byzantines sent a message to Achaeus
asking for aid, and an escort to conduct Tiboetes from
Macedonia. For it was believed that Tiboetes had as good a
claim to the kingdom of Bithynia as Prusias, who was his
nephew.</p>

<p><a name="b4_51" id="b4_51"><b>51.</b></a> But seeing the confident spirit of the Byzantines, the
Rhodians adopted an exceedingly able plan to
obtain their object. <span class="sidenote">The Rhodians
secure the
friendship of
Achaeus.</span>
They perceived that the
resolution of the Byzantines in venturing on
the war rested mainly on their hopes of the
support of Achaeus. Now they knew that the father of
Achaeus was detained at Alexandria, and that Achaeus was
exceedingly anxious for his father&#8217;s safety: they therefore hit
upon the idea of sending an embassy to Ptolemy, and asking
him to deliver this Andromachus to them. This request,
indeed, they had before made, but without laying any great
stress upon it: now, however, they were genuinely anxious for
it; that, by doing this favour to Achaeus, they might lay him
under such an obligation to them, that he would be unable to
refuse any request they might make to him. When the
ambassadors arrived, Ptolemy at first deliberated as to detaining
Andromachus; because there still remained some points of
dispute between himself and Antiochus unsettled; and Achaeus,
who had recently declared himself king, could exercise a
decisive influence in several important particulars. For
Andromachus was not only father of Achaeus, but brother also
of Laodice, the wife of Seleucus.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> However, on a review of
the whole situation, Ptolemy inclined to the Rhodians; and
being anxious to show them every favour, he yielded to their
request, and handed over Andromachus to them to conduct to
his son. Having accordingly done this, and having conferred
some additional marks of honour on Achaeus, they deprived the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>Byzantines of their most important hope. And this was not
the only disappointment which the Byzantines had to
encounter; for as Tiboetes was being escorted from
Macedonia, he entirely defeated their plans by dying. This
misfortune damped the ardour of the Byzantines, while it
encouraged Prusias to push on the war. On the Asiatic side
he carried it on in person, and with great energy; while on the
European side he hired Thracians who prevented the Byzantines
from leaving their gates. For their party being thus
baulked of their hopes, and surrounded on every side by
enemies, the Byzantines began to look about then for some
decent pretext for withdrawing from the war.</p>

<p><a name="b4_52" id="b4_52"><b>52.</b></a> So when the Gallic king, Cavarus, came to Byzantium,
and showed himself eager to put an end to the
war, <span class="sidenote">The Gallic king,
Cavarus, negotiates
a peace,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
and earnestly offered his friendly intervention,
both Prusias and the Byzantines consented
to his proposals. And when the
Rhodians were informed of the interference of Cavarus and
the consent of Prusias, being very anxious to secure their own
object also, they elected Aridices as ambassador to Byzantium,
and sent Polemocles with him in command of three triremes,
wishing, as the saying is, to send the Byzantines &#8220;spear
and herald&#8217;s staff at once.&#8221; Upon their appearance a pacification
was arranged, in the year of Cothon, son of Callisthenes,
Hieromnemon in Byzantium.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> The treaty with the
Rhodians was simple: &#8220;The Byzantines will not collect toll
from any ship sailing into the Pontus; and in that case the
Rhodians and their allies are at peace with the Byzantines.&#8221;
But that with Prusias contained the following provisions:
&#8220;There shall be peace and amity for ever between Prusias
and the Byzantines; the Byzantines shall in no way attack
Prusias, nor Prusias the Byzantines. Prusias shall restore to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>Byzantines all lands, forts, populations, and prisoners of war,
without ransom; and besides these things, the ships taken at
the beginning of the war, and the arms seized in the fortresses;
and also the timbers, stone-work, and roofing belonging to the
fort called Hieron&#8221; (for Prusias, in his terror of the approach of
Tiboetes, had pulled down every fort which seemed to lie
conveniently for him): &#8220;finally, Prusias shall compel such of
the Bithynians as have any property taken from the Byzantine
district of Mysia to restore it to the farmers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such were the beginning and end of the war of Rhodes and
Prusias with Byzantium.</p>

<p><a name="b4_53" id="b4_53"><b>53.</b></a> At the same time the Cnossians sent an embassy to
the Rhodians, and persuaded them to send them <span class="sidenote">War between
Rhodes and
Crete.</span>
the ships that were under the command of Polemocles,
and to launch three undecked vessels
besides and send them also to Crete. The Rhodians having
complied, and the vessels having arrived at Crete, the people
of Eleutherna suspecting that one of their citizens named
Timarchus had been put to death by Polemocles to please the
Cnossians, first proclaimed a right of reprisal against the
Rhodians, and then went to open war with them.</p>

<p><a name="b4_54" id="b4_54"><b>54.</b></a> The people of Lyttos,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> too, a short time before this, met
with an irretrievable disaster. <span class="sidenote">The destruction
of Lyttos.</span>
At that time
the political state of Crete as a whole was this.
The Cnossians, in league with the people of
Gortyn, had a short time previously reduced the whole island
under their power, with the exception of the city of Lyttos;
and this being the only city which refused obedience, they
resolved to go to war with it, being bent upon removing
its inhabitants from their homes, as an example and terror to
the rest of Crete. Accordingly at first the whole of the other
Cretan cities were united in war against Lyttos: but presently
when some jealousy arose from certain trifling causes, as is the
way with the Cretans, they separated into hostile parties, the
peoples of Polyrrhen, Cere, and Lappa, along with the Horii
and Arcades,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> forming one party and separating themselves
from connexion with the Cnossians, resolved to make common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>cause with the Lyttians. Among the people of Gortyn,
again, the elder men espoused the side of Cnossus, the younger
that of Lyttos, and so were in opposition to each other. Taken
by surprise by this disintegration of their allies, the Cnossians
fetched over a thousand men from Aetolia in virtue of their
alliance: upon which the party of the elders in Gortyn
immediately seized the citadel; introduced the Cnossians
and Aetolians; and either expelled or put to death the young
men, and delivered the city into the hands of the Cnossians.
And at the same time, the Lyttians having gone out with their
full forces on an expedition into the enemy&#8217;s territory, the
Cnossians got information of the fact, and seized Lyttos while
thus denuded of its defenders. The children and women they
sent to Cnossus; and having set fire to the town, thrown down
its buildings, and damaged it in every possible way, returned.
When the Lyttians reached home from their expedition, and
saw what had happened, they were struck with such violent
grief that not a man of the whole host had the heart to enter
his native city; but one and all having marched round its
walls, with frequent cries and lamentations over their misfortune
and that of their country, turned back again towards the city
of Lappa. The people of Lappa gave them a kind and entirely
cordial reception; and having thus in one day become cityless
and aliens, they joined these allies in their war against the
Cnossians. Thus at one fell swoop was Lyttos, a colony of
Sparta and allied with the Lacedaemonians in blood, the most
ancient of the cities in Crete, and by common consent the
mother of the bravest men in the island, utterly cut off.</p>

<p><a name="b4_55" id="b4_55"><b>55.</b></a> But the peoples of Polyrrhen and Lappa and all their
allies, seeing that the Cnossians clung to
the alliance of the Aetolians, <span class="sidenote">Appeal to the
Achaeans and
Philip.</span>
and that the
Aetolians were at war with King Philip and
the Achaeans, sent ambassadors to the two latter asking
for their help and to be admitted to alliance with them.
Both requests were granted: they were admitted into the roll
of allies, and assistance was sent to them, consisting of four
hundred Illyrians under Plator, two hundred Achaeans, and a
hundred Phocians; whose arrival was of the utmost advantage
to the interest of Polyrrhenia and her allies: for in a brief space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
of time they shut the Eleuthernaeans and Cydonians within
their walls, and compelled the people of Aptera to forsake the
alliance of the Cnossians and share their fortunes. When these
results had been obtained, the Polyrrhenians and their allies
joined in sending to the aid of Philip and the Achaeans five
hundred Cretans, the Cnossians having sent a thousand to the
Aetolians a short time before; both of which contingents took
part in the existing war on their respective sides. Nay more,
the exiled party of Gortyn seized the harbour of Phaestus,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a>
and also by a sudden and bold attack occupied the port of
Gortyn itself; and from these two places as bases of operation
they carried on the war with the party in the town. Such was
the state of Crete.</p>

<p><a name="b4_56" id="b4_56"><b>56.</b></a> About the same time Mithridates also declared war
against the people of Sinope; <span class="sidenote">Mithridates IV.,
king of Pontus,
declares war
against Sinope.</span>
which proved to
be the beginning and occasion of the disaster
which ultimately befell the Sinopeans. Upon
their sending an embassy with a view to this
war to beg for assistance from the Rhodians, the latter
decided to elect three men, and to grant them a hundred and
forty thousand drachmae with which to procure supplies
needed by the Sinopeans. The men so appointed got ready
ten thousand jars of wine, three hundred talents<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> of prepared
hair, a hundred talents of made-up bowstring, a thousand
suits of armour, three thousand gold pieces, and four
catapults with engineers to work them. The Sinopean
envoys took these presents and departed; for the people
of Sinope, being in great anxiety lest Mithridates should
attempt to besiege them both by land and sea, were making
all manner of preparations with this view. Sinope lies on the
right-hand shore of the Pontus as one sails to Phasis, and is built
upon a peninsula jutting out into the sea: it is on the neck of
this peninsula, connecting it with Asia, which is not more than
two stades wide, that the city is so placed as to entirely close
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>it up from sea to sea; the rest of the peninsula stretches out
into the open sea,&mdash;a piece of flat land from which the town
is easily accessible, but surrounded by a steep coast offering
very bad harbourage, and having exceedingly few spots admitting
of disembarkation. The Sinopeans then were dreadfully
alarmed lest Mithridates should blockade them, by throwing
up works against their town on the side towards Asia, and by
making a descent on the opposite side upon the low ground
in front of the town: and they accordingly determined to
strengthen the line of the peninsula, where it was washed by
the sea, by putting up wooden defences and erecting palisades
round the places accessible from the sea; and at the same
time by storing weapons and stationing guards at all points
open to attack: for the whole area is not large, but is capable
of being easily defended and by a moderate force.</p>

<p>Such was the situation at Sinope at the time of the commencement
of the Social war,&mdash;to which I must now return.</p>

<p><a name="b4_57" id="b4_57"><b>57.</b></a> King Philip started from Macedonia with his army for

Night surprise
of Aegira.</span>
And
at the same time Alexander and Dorimachus,
having succeeded in establishing an intrigue
for the betrayal of Aegira, had collected about
twelve hundred Aetolians into Oeanthe, which
is in Aetolia, exactly opposite the above-named
town; and, having prepared vessels to convey
them across the gulf, were waiting for favourable weather for
making the voyage in fulfilment of their design. For a
deserter from Aetolia, who had spent a long time at Aegira,
and had had full opportunity of observing that the guards of
the gate towards Aegium were in the habit of getting drunk, and
keeping their watch with great slackness, had again and again
crossed over to Dorimachus; and, laying this fact before him,
had invited him to make the attempt, well knowing that he
was thoroughly accustomed to such practices. The city of
Aegira lies on the Peloponnesian coast of the Corinthian gulf,
between the cities of Aegium and Sicyon, upon some strong
and inaccessible heights, facing towards Parnassus and that
district of the opposite coast, and standing about seven stades<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
back from the sea. At the mouth of the river which flows
past this town Dorimachus dropped anchor under cover of
night, having at length obtained favourable weather for
crossing. He and Alexander, accompanied by Archidamus the
son of Pantaleon and the main body of the Aetolians, then
advanced towards the city along the road leading from Aegium.
But the deserter, with twenty of the most active men, having
made his way by a shorter cut than the others over the cliffs
where there was no road, owing to his knowledge of the
locality, got into the city through a certain water-course and
found the guards of the gate still asleep. Having killed them
while actually in their beds, and cut the bolts of the gates with
their axes, they opened them to the Aetolians. Having thus
surprised the town, they behaved with a conspicuous want of
caution, which eventually saved the people of Aegira, and
proved the destruction of the Aetolians themselves. They
seemed to imagine that to get within the gates was all there
was to do in occupying an enemy&#8217;s town; and accordingly
acted as I shall now describe.</p>

<p><a name="b4_58" id="b4_58"><b>58.</b></a> They kept together for a very brief space of time
near the market-place, and then scattering
in every direction, <span class="sidenote">Alexander killed.</span>
in their passion for plunder,
rushed into the houses and began carrying off the wealth
they contained. But it was now broad daylight: and the
attack being wholly unexpected and sudden, those of
the Aegiratans whose houses were actually entered by the
enemy, in the utmost terror and alarm, all took to flight and
made their way out of the town, believing it to be completely in
the power of the enemy; but those of them whose houses were
untouched, and who, hearing the shouting, sallied out to the
rescue, all rushed with one accord to the citadel. These last
continually increased in number and confidence; while the
Aetolians on the contrary kept continually becoming less
closely united, and less subject to discipline, from the causes
above mentioned. But Dorimachus, becoming conscious of
his danger, rallied his men and charged the citizens who were
occupying the citadel: imagining that, by acting with decision
and boldness, he would terrify and turn to flight those who
had rallied to defend the town. But the Aegiratans, cheering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
each other on, offered a strenuous resistance, and grappled
gallantly with the Aetolians. The citadel being unwalled, and
the struggle being at close quarters and man to man, the battle
was at first as desperate as might be expected between two
sides, of which one was fighting for country and children, the
other for bare life. Finally the invading Aetolians were repulsed:
and the Aegiratans, taking advantage of their higher
position, made a fierce and vigorous charge down the slope
upon the enemy; which struck such terror in them, that in the
confusion that followed the fugitives trampled each other to
death at the gates. Alexander himself fell fighting in the
actual battle; but Archidamus was killed in the struggle and
crush at the gates. Of the main body of Aetolians, some
were trampled to death; others flying over the pathless hills
fell over precipices and broke their necks; while such as
escaped in safety to the ships managed, after shamefully
throwing away their arms, to sail away and escape from what
seemed a desperate danger. Thus it came about that the
Aegiratans having lost their city by their carelessness, unexpectedly
regained it by their valour and gallantry.</p>

<p><a name="b4_59" id="b4_59"><b>59.</b></a> About the same time Euripidas, who had been sent
out to act as general to the Eleans, <span class="sidenote">Euripidas.</span>
after
overrunning the districts of Dyme, Pharae,
and Tritaea, and collecting a considerable amount of
booty, was marching back to Elis. But Miccus of Dyme,
who happened at the time to be Sub-strategus of the
Achaean league, went out to the rescue with a body of
Dymaeans, Pharaeans, and Tritaeans, and attacked him as he
was returning. But proceeding too precipitately, he fell into
an ambush and lost a large number of his men: for forty of
his infantry were killed and about two hundred taken prisoners.
Elated by this success, Euripidas a few days afterwards made
another expedition, and seized a fort belonging to the Dymaeans
on the river Araxus, standing in an excellent situation, and
called the Wall, which the myths affirm to have been anciently
built by Hercules, when at war with the Eleans, as a base of
operations against them.</p>

<p><a name="b4_60" id="b4_60"><b>60.</b></a> The peoples of Dyme, Pharae, and Tritaea having
been worsted in their attempt to relieve the country, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
afraid of what would happen from this capture of the fort,
first sent messengers to the Strategus, Aratus, <span class="sidenote">Inactivity of
Aratus. Dyme,
Pharae, and
Tritaea separate
from the league.</span>
to
inform him of what had happened and to ask for
aid, and afterwards a formal embassy with the
same request. But Aratus was unable to get the
mercenaries together, because in the Cleomenic
war the Achaeans had failed to pay some of the wages of the hired
troops: and his entire policy and management of the whole war
was in a word without spirit or nerve. Accordingly Lycurgus
seized the Athenaeum of Megalopolis, and Euripidas followed
up his former successes by taking Gortyna<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> in the territory of
Telphusa. But the people of Dyme, Pharae, and Tritaea,
despairing of assistance from the Strategus, came to a mutual
agreement to cease paying the common contribution to the
Achaean league, and to collect a mercenary army on their own
account, three hundred infantry and fifty horse; and to secure
the country by their means. In this action they were considered
to have shown a prudent regard for their own interests,
but not for those of the community at large; for they were
thought to have set an evil example, and supplied a precedent
to those whose wish it was to break up the league. But in
fact the chief blame for their proceeding must rightfully be assigned
to the Strategus, who pursued such a dilatory policy, and
slighted or wholly rejected the prayers for help which reached
him from time to time. For as long as he has any hope, from
relations and allies, any man who is in danger will cling to
them; but when in his distress he has to give up that hope, he
is forced to help himself the best way he can. Wherefore we
must not find fault with the people of Tritaea, Pharae, and
Dyme for having mercenaries on their own account, when the
chief magistrate of the league hesitated to act: but some blame
does attach to them for renouncing the joint contribution.
They certainly were not bound to neglect to secure their own
safety by every opportunity and means in their power; but
they were bound at the same time to keep up their just dues
to the league: especially as the recovery of such payment was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>perfectly secured to them by the common laws; and most of
all because they had been the originators of the Achaean
confederacy.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p><a name="b4_61" id="b4_61"><b>61.</b></a> Such was the state of things in the Peloponnese when
King Philip, after crossing Thessaly, <span class="sidenote">Philip V. at
Ambracia,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219.</span>
arrived
in Epirus. Reinforcing his Macedonians by
a full levy of Epirotes, and being joined by
three hundred slingers from Achaia, and the five hundred
Cretans sent him by the Polyrrhenians, he continued his
march through Epirus and arrived in the territory of the
Ambracians. Now, if he had continued his march without
interruption, and thrown himself into the interior of Aetolia, by
the sudden and unlooked-for attack of so formidable an
army he would have put an end to the whole campaign: but
as it was, he was over-persuaded by the Epirotes to take
Ambracus first; and so gave the Aetolians an interval in which
to make a stand, to take precautionary measures, and to prepare
for the future. For the Epirotes, thinking more of their own
advantage than of that of the confederacy, and being very
anxious to get Ambracus<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> into their power, begged Philip to
invest the town and take it before doing anything else: the
fact being that they regarded it as a matter of the utmost
importance to recover Ambracia from the Aetolians; and
thought that the only way of doing this was to become
masters of this place, Ambracus, and besiege the town of
Ambracia from it. For Ambracus is a place strongly fortified
by walls and out-works, standing in the midst of marshes, and
approached from the land by only one narrow raised causeway;
and commanding by its situation both the district and town
of Ambracia.</p>

<p><a name="b4_62" id="b4_62"><b>62.</b></a> While Philip, then, by the persuasion of the Epirotes, pitching his
camp near Ambracus, was engaged in making his preparations for the
siege, Scopas raised a general levy of Aetolians, and marching through
Thessaly crossed the frontiers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
of Macedonia; traversed the plain of
Plena, and laid it waste; and after securing considerable booty, <span class="sidenote">Scopas

that town abandoning the place, he entered it and threw down its walls,
houses, and gymnasium; set fire to the covered walks round the sacred
enclosure, and destroyed all the other offerings which had been placed
in it, either for ornament, or for the use of visitors to the public
assemblies, and threw down all the statues of the kings. And this man,
who, at the very beginning and first action of the war, had thus turned
his arms against the gods as well as men, was not treated on his return
to Aetolia as guilty of impiety, but was honoured and looked up to. For
he had indeed filled the Aetolians with empty hopes and irrational
conceit. From this time they indulged the idea that no one would venture
to set foot in Aetolia, while they would be able without resistance not
only to plunder the Peloponnese, which they were quite accustomed to do,
but Thessaly and Macedonia also.</p>

<p><a name="b4_63" id="b4_63"><b>63.</b></a> When he heard what had happened in Macedonia, and
had thus paid on the spot for the selfishness
and folly of the Epirotes, <span class="sidenote">Ambracus
taken.</span>
Philip proceeded to
besiege Ambracus. By an energetic use of
earthworks, and other siege operations, he quickly terrified the
people into submission, and the place surrendered after a delay
of forty days in all. He let the garrison, consisting of five
hundred Aetolians, depart on fixed conditions, and gratified the
cupidity of the Epirotes by handing over Ambracus to them,
while he himself set his army in motion, and marched by way
of Charadra, being anxious to cross the Ambracian gulf
where it is narrowest, that is to say, near the Acarnanian
temple called Actium. For this gulf is a branch of the
Sicilian sea between Epirus and Acarnania, with a very narrow
opening of less than five stades, but expanding as it extends
inland to a breadth of a hundred stades; while the length of
the whole arm from the open sea is about three hundred
stades. It forms the boundary between Epirus on the north
and Acarnania on the south. Philip, therefore, having got his
army across this entrance of the gulf, and advanced through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Acarnania, came to the city of Phoeteiae, which belonged to
the Aetolians;<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> having, during his march, <span class="sidenote">Philip enters
Aetolia; takes
Phoeteiae.</span>
been
joined by an Acarnanian force of two thousand
foot and two hundred horse. Encamping
under the walls of this town, and making energetic and
formidable assaults upon it during two days, it was surrendered
to him on terms, and the Aetolian garrison were
dismissed on parole. Next night, however, five hundred other
Aetolians, believing the town still untaken, came to its relief;
whose arrival being ascertained beforehand by the king, he
stationed some men in ambush at certain convenient spots,
and slew most of the new-comers and captured all but a very
few of the rest. After these events, he distributed a month&#8217;s
rations of corn among his men from what had been captured,
for a large store was found collected at Phoeteiae, and then
continued his advance into the territory of Stratus. At
about ten stades from that town he pitched his camp on the
banks of the river Achelous; and from that began laying waste
the country without resistance, none of the enemy venturing
out to attack him.</p>

<p><a name="b4_64" id="b4_64"><b>64.</b></a> Meanwhile the Achaeans, being hard pressed by the
war, and ascertaining that the king was not
far off, <span class="sidenote">Metropolis and
Conope.</span>
sent ambassadors to him begging
for help. They found Philip still in his camp
near Stratus, and there delivered their commission: and
besides the message with which they were charged, they
pointed out to him the richness of the booty which his army
would get from the enemy&#8217;s country, and tried to persuade him
to cross to Rhium and invade Elis. The king listened to
what they had to say, and kept the ambassadors with him,
alleging that he must consider of their request; and meanwhile
broke up his camp, and marched in the direction of
Metropolis and Conope. The Aetolians kept possession of the
citadel of Metropolis but abandoned the town: whereupon
Philip set fire to Metropolis, and continued his advance against
Conope. But when the Aetolian horse rallied and ventured
to meet him at the ford of the Achelous, which is about twenty
stades before you reach the town, believing that they would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
either stop his advance altogether, or inflict much damage on
the Macedonians while crossing the river; <span class="sidenote">Skirmish on the

the king, fully understanding their tactics,
ordered his light-armed troops to enter the
river first and to cross it in close order, keeping to their
regular companies, and with shields interlocked. His orders
were obeyed: and as soon as the first company had effected
the crossing, the Aetolian cavalry attacked it; but they could
make no impression upon it, standing as it did in close order,
and being joined in similar close order, shield to shield, by a
second and a third company as they crossed. Therefore they
wheeled off discomfited and retired to the city. <span class="sidenote">Ithoria.</span>From this
time forth the proud gallantry of the Aetolians
was fain to confine itself to the protection of
the towns, and keep quiet; while Philip crossed with
his army, and after wasting this district also without resistance,
arrived at Ithoria. This is a position completely
commanding the road, and of extraordinary strength, natural
as well as artificial. On his approach, however, the garrison
occupying the place abandoned it in a panic; and the king,
taking possession, levelled it to the ground: and gave orders
to his skirmishing parties to treat all forts in the district in
the same way.</p>

<p><a name="b4_65" id="b4_65"><b>65.</b></a> Having thus passed the narrow part of the road, he
proceeded at a slow and deliberate pace, giving his army time
to collect booty from the country; and by the time he reached
Oeniadae his army was richly provided with every kind of
goods. But he resolved first to take Paeanium: <span class="sidenote">Paeanium.</span>
and having pitched his camp under its walls,
by a series of assaults carried the place by force,&mdash;a
town not large in circumference, for that was less
than seven stades, but second to none in the construction
of its houses, walls, and towers. The wall of this town
he levelled with its foundation, and, breaking down its
houses, he packed their timbers and tiles with great care upon
rafts, and sent them down the river to Oeniadae. At first the
Aetolians resolved to hold the citadel in Oeniadae, which they
had strengthened with walls and other fortifications; but upon
Philip&#8217;s approach they evacuated it in a panic. The king<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
therefore having taken this city also, advanced from it and
encamped on a certain secure position in Calydonia, called
Elaeus, which had been rendered extraordinarily strong with
walls and other fortifications by Attalus, who undertook the
work for the Aetolians. Having carried this also by assault,
and plundered the whole of Calydonia, the Macedonians returned
to Oeniadae. <span class="sidenote">Fortifies Oeniadae.</span>And observing the convenient position
of this place for all purposes, and especially
as providing a place of embarkation for the
Peloponnese, Philip resolved to build a wall round the town.
For Oeniadae lies on the sea-coast, at the juncture of the
Acarnanian and Aetolian frontiers, just at the entrance of the
Corinthian gulf; and the town faces the sea-coast of Dyme in
the Peloponnesus, and is the nearest point to the promontory
of Araxus in it; for the intervening sea is not more than a hundred
stades across. Looking to these facts he fortified the citadel
by itself; and, building a wall round the harbour and dockyards,
was intending to connect them with the citadel, employing
for the construction the materials brought from Paeanium.</p>

<p><a name="b4_66" id="b4_66"><b>66.</b></a> But whilst he was still engaged on this work, news was
brought to the king that the Dardani, <span class="sidenote">Philip recalled to
Macedonia by a
threatened
invasion of
Dardani.</span>
suspecting
his intention of invading the Peloponnese, were
collecting forces and making great preparations
with the determination of invading Macedonia.
When he heard this, Philip made up his mind
that he was bound to go with all speed to the protection of
Macedonia: and accordingly he dismissed the Achaean envoys
with the answer, which he now gave them, that when he had
taken effectual measures with regard to the circumstances that
had just been announced to him, he would look upon it as his
first business to bring them aid to the best of his ability.
Thereupon he broke up his camp, and began his return march
with all speed, by the same route as that by which he had
come. When he was on the point of recrossing the Ambracian
gulf from Acarnania into Epirus, Demetrius of Pharos presented
himself, sailing with a single galley, having just been banished
from Illyria by the Romans,&mdash;as I have stated in the previous
book.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Philip received him with kindness and bade him sail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
to Corinth, and go thence through Thessaly to Macedonia;
while he himself crossed into Epirus and pushed on without a
halt. When he had reached Pella in Macedonia, the Dardani
learnt from some Thracian deserters that he was in the country,
and they at once in a panic broke up their army, though they
were close to the Macedonian frontier. And Philip, being
informed of their change of purpose, dismissed his Macedonian
soldiers to gather in their harvest: <span class="sidenote">Late summer of
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219.</span>
while he
himself went to Thessaly, and spent the rest of
the summer at Larisa.</p>

<p>It was at this season that Aemilius celebrated a splendid
triumph at Rome for his Illyrian victories; <span class="sidenote">Contemporary
events in Spain
and Italy.</span>
and
Hannibal after the capture of Saguntum dismissed
his troops into winter quarters; while the Romans,
on hearing of the capture of Saguntum, were sending ambassadors
to Carthage to demand the surrender of Hannibal,
and at the same time were making preparations for the war
after electing Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius Sempronius
Longus Consuls for the following year, as I have stated in
detail in the previous book. My object in recalling the facts
here is to carry out my original plan of showing what events in
various parts of the world were contemporaneous.</p>

<p><a name="b4_67" id="b4_67"><b>67.</b></a> And so the first year of this Olympiad was drawing
to a close. In Aetolia, the time of the elections
having come round, <span class="sidenote">Midsummer <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
217. Dorimachus
Aetolian
Strategus,
Sept. <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;119.</span>
Dorimachus was elected
Strategus. He was no sooner invested with his
office, than, summoning the Aetolian forces,
he made an armed foray upon the highlands
of Epirus, and began wasting the country with an
even stronger passion for destruction than usual; for his
object in everything he did was not so much
to secure booty for himself, as to damage the
Epirotes. <span class="sidenote">Destroys Dodona.</span>
And having come to Dodona<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> he burnt the colonnades,
destroyed the sacred offerings, and even demolished
the sacred building; so that we may say that the Aetolians
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>had no regard for the laws of peace or war, but in the one as
well as in the other, acted in defiance of the customs and
principles of mankind. After those, and other similar achievements,
Dorimachus returned home.</p>

<p>But the winter being now considerably advanced, and all
idea of the king coming being given up owing
to the time of the year, <span class="sidenote">Philip starts
again.</span>
Philip suddenly started
from Larisa with an army of three thousand hoplites armed
with brass shields, two thousand light-armed, three hundred
Cretans, and four hundred horse of the royal guard; and
having transported them into Euboea and thence to Cynos he
came through Boeotia and the Megarid to
Corinth, <span class="sidenote">Dec. <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219.</span>
about the time of the winter solstice;
having conducted his arrival with such promptitude and
secrecy, that not a single Peloponnesian suspected it. He at
once closed the gates of Corinth and secured the roads by
guards; and on the very next day sent for Aratus the elder
to come to him from Sicyon, and issued despatches to the
Strategus of the Achaean league and the cities, in which he
named a time and place for them all to meet him in arms.
Having made these arrangements, he again started, and pitched
his camp near the temple of the Dioscuri in Phliasia.</p>

<p><a name="b4_68" id="b4_68"><b>68.</b></a> Meanwhile Euripidas, with two companies of Eleans,&mdash;who
combined with the pirates and mercenaries <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218,
Jan.-Feb.
Destruction of a
marauding army
of Eleans under
Euripidas.</span>
made up an army of two thousand two hundred
men, besides a hundred horse,&mdash;started from
Psophis and began marching by way of Pheneus
and Stymphalus, knowing nothing about Philip&#8217;s
arrival, with the purpose of wasting the territory
of Sicyon. The very night in which it chanced that Philip
had pitched his camp near the temple of the Dioscuri, he
passed the royal quarters, and succeeded in entering the
territory of Sicyon, about the time of the morning watch. But
some Cretans of Philip&#8217;s army who had left their ranks, and
were prowling about on the track of prey, fell into the hands
of Euripidas, and being questioned by him informed him of
the arrival of the Macedonians. Without saying a word of his
discovery to any one, he at once caused his army to face
about, and marched back by the same road as that by which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
he had come; with the intention and hope of getting through
Stymphalia, and reaching the difficult ground beyond it, before
the Macedonians could catch him. But the king knowing
nothing at all about the proceedings of the enemy, at daybreak
broke up his camp and began his advance in pursuance of his
original plan, determining to march by way of Stymphalus itself
to Caphyae: for it was at that town that he had written to the
Achaeans to meet him.</p>

<p><a name="b4_69" id="b4_69"><b>69.</b></a> Now it happened that, just as the Macedonian advanced
guard came to the top of the hill, <span class="sidenote">The Eleans come
across the
Macedonians at
the junction of
the two roads
above
Stymphalus.</span>
near a place
called Apelaurus, about ten stades before you
come to Stymphalus, the advanced guard of
the Eleans converged upon it also. Understanding
from his previous information what
had happened, Euripidas took some horsemen
with him and avoided the danger by flight, making his way
across country to Psophis. The rest of the Eleans being thus
deserted by their leader, and panic-struck at what had
happened, remained stationary on the road, not knowing what
to do, or which way to turn. For at first their officers
imagined that the troops they saw were some Achaeans come
out to resist them. What favoured this mistake more than
anything else were the brass shields of the hoplites: for they
imagined that they were Megalopolitans, because the soldiers
of that town had borne shields of that sort at the battle of
Sellasia against Cleomenes, King Antigonus having furnished
them for the occasion. Under this idea, they retired in good
order to some rising ground, by no means despairing of getting
off safely: but as soon as the Macedonians had advanced close
up to them, grasping the true state of the case, they threw
down their shields and fled. About twelve hundred of them
were taken prisoners; but the rest perished utterly, some at
the hands of the Macedonians, and others by falling down
precipices: and finally not more than a hundred altogether
escaped. Having despatched the spoils and the prisoners to
Corinth, Philip continued his expedition. But a great impression
was made upon the Peloponnesians: for they had not
heard of the king&#8217;s arrival until they heard of his victory.</p>

<p><a name="b4_70" id="b4_70"><b>70.</b></a> Continuing his march through Arcadia, and encountering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
heavy snow storms and much fatigue in the pass over
Mount Oligyrtus, he arrived on the third day at
Caphyae. <span class="sidenote">Philip advances
to Psophis.</span>
There he rested his army for two
days, and was joined by Aratus the younger,
and the Achaean soldiers whom he had collected; so that,
with an army now amounting to ten thousand men, he advanced
by way of Clitoria towards Psophis, collecting missiles and
scaling ladders from the towns through which he passed.
Psophis is a place of acknowledged antiquity, <span class="sidenote">A description of
Psophis.</span>
and a colony of the Arcadian town of Azanis.
Taking the Peloponnesus as a whole, it occupies
a central position in the country; but in regard to Arcadia it
is on its western frontier, and is close also to the western
borderland of Achaia: its position also commands the territory
of the Eleans, with whom at that time it was politically united.
Philip reached this town on the third day after leaving Caphyae,
and pitched his camp on some rising ground overhanging the
city, from which he could in perfect security command a view
both of the whole town and the country round it. But when the
king saw the great strength of the place, he was at a loss what
to do. Along the left side of it rushes a violent winter torrent,
which for the greater part of the winter is impassable, and in
any case renders the city secure and difficult of approach, owing
to the size of the bed which its waters have worn out for themselves
by slow degrees, in the course of ages, as it comes rushing
down from the higher ground. On the east again there is a
broad and rapid river, the Erymanthus, about which so many
tales are told. This river is joined by the winter torrent at a
point south of the town, which is thus defended on three sides
by these streams; while the fourth, or northern, side is commanded
by a hill, which has been fortified, and serves as a
convenient and efficient citadel. The town has walls also of
unusual size and construction; and besides all this, a reinforcement
of Eleans happened to have just come in, and Euripidas
himself was in the town after his escape from Stymphalus.</p>

<p><a name="b4_71" id="b4_71"><b>71.</b></a> The sight of these things caused Philip much anxious
thought. Sometimes he was for giving up his plan of
attacking and besieging the place: at others the excellence of
its situation made him eager to accomplish this. For just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
it was then a source of danger to the Achaeans and Arcadians,
and a safe place of arms for the Eleans; <span class="sidenote">Capture of
Psophis.</span>
so
would it on the other hand, if captured,
become a source of safety to the Arcadians,
and a most convenient base of operations for the allies
against the Eleans. These considerations finally decided
him to make the attempt: and he therefore issued orders to
the Macedonians to get their breakfasts at daybreak, and be
ready for service with all preparations completed. Everything
being done as he ordered, the king led his army over the bridge
across the Erymanthus; and no one having offered him resistance,
owing to the unexpectedness of the movement, he arrived
under the walls of the town in gallant style and with formidable
show. Euripidas and the garrison were overpowered with
astonishment; because they had felt certain that the enemy
would not venture on an assault, or try to carry a town of such
strength; and that a siege could not last long either, owing to
the severity of the season. This calculation of chances made
them begin to entertain suspicions of each other, from a misgiving
that Philip must have established a secret intrigue with
some persons in the town against it. But finding that nothing
of the sort existed among themselves, the greater number
hurried to the walls to defend them, while the mercenary
Elean soldiers sallied out of a gate in the upper part of the
town to attack the enemy. The king stationed his men who
had ladders at three different spots, and divided the other
Macedonians among these three parties; this being arranged,
he gave the signal by the sound of trumpet, and began the
assault on the walls at once. At first the garrison offered a
spirited resistance and hurled many of the enemy from their
ladders; but when the supply of weapons inside the town, as
well as other necessary materials, began to run short,&mdash;as was to
be expected from the hasty nature of the preparations for
defence,&mdash;and the Macedonians showed no sign of terror, the
next man filling up the place of each who was hurled from the
scaling-ladder, the garrison at length turned to flight, and made
their escape one and all into the citadel. In the king&#8217;s army
the Macedonians then made good their footing on the wall,
while the Cretans went against the party of mercenaries who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
had sallied from the upper gate, and forced them to throw away
their shields and fly in disorder. Following the fugitives with
slaughter, they forced their way along with them through the
gate: so that the town was captured at all points at once.
The Psophidians with their wives and children retreated into
the citadel, and Euripidas with them, as well as all the soldiers
who had escaped destruction.</p>

<p><a name="b4_72" id="b4_72"><b>72.</b></a> Having thus carried the place, the Macedonians at once
plundered all the furniture of the houses;
and then, setting up
their quarters in the houses, took regular possession of the
town. But the people who had taken refuge in a body in the
citadel, having no provisions with them, <span class="sidenote">Surrender of
the citadel of
Psophis.</span>and
well foreseeing what must happen, made up
their minds to give themselves up to Philip.
They accordingly sent a herald to the king; and having
received a safe-conduct for an embassy, they despatched their
magistrates and Euripidas with them on this mission, who
made terms with the king by which the lives and liberties
of all who were on the citadel, whether citizens or foreigners,
were secured. The ambassadors then returned whence they
came, carrying an order to the people to remain where they
were until the army had marched out, for fear any of the
soldiers should disobey orders and plunder them. A fall of snow
however compelled the king to remain where he was for some
days; in the course of which he summoned a meeting of such
Achaeans as were in the army, and after pointing out to them
the strength and excellent position of the town for the purposes
of the present war, he spoke also of his own friendly disposition
towards their nation: and ended by saying, &#8220;We hereby
yield up and present this town to the Achaeans; for it is our
purpose to show them all the favour in our power, and to
omit nothing that may testify to our zeal.&#8221; After receiving
the thanks of Aratus and the meeting, Philip dismissed the
assembly, and getting his army in motion, marched towards
Lasion. The Psophidians descending from the citadel received
back the possession of the town, each man recovering his own
house; while Euripidas departed to Corinth, and thence to
Aetolia. Those of the Achaean magistrates who were present
put Prolaus of Sicyon in command of the citadel, with an adequate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
garrison; and Pythias of Pallene in command of the
town. Such was the end of the incident of Psophis.</p>

<p><a name="b4_73" id="b4_73"><b>73.</b></a> But when the Elean garrison of Lasion heard of the
coming of the Macedonians, <span class="sidenote">Lasion and
Stratus.</span>
and were informed
of what had taken place at Psophis,
they at once abandoned the town; so that
upon his arrival the king took it immediately, and by way
of enhancing his favours to the Achaeans handed Lasion
also over to them; and in a similar spirit restored Stratus
to the Telphusians, which was also evacuated by the Eleans.
On the fifth day after settling these matters he arrived at
Olympia. <span class="sidenote">Philip at Olympia.</span>
There he offered a sacrifice to Zeus
and entertained his officers at a banquet;
and, having given his army three days&#8217; rest, commenced
his return march. After advancing some way into Elis, he
allowed foraging parties to scour the country while he himself
lay encamped near Artemisium, as it is called; and after receiving
the booty there, he removed to the Dioscurium.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> In
the course of this devastation of the country the number of the
captives was indeed great, but a still greater number made
their escape to the neighbouring villages and strongholds. <span class="sidenote">Prosperity of Elis.</span>
For
Elis is more populous, as well as more richly
furnished with slaves and other property, than
the rest of the Peloponnese: and some of the Eleans are so
enamoured of a country life, that there are cases of families
who, being in enjoyment of considerable wealth, have for two
or three generations never entered a public law-court at all.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>
And this result is brought about by the great care and attention
bestowed upon the agricultural class by the government, to
see that their law-suits should be settled on the spot, and every
necessary of life abundantly supplied them. To me it seems
that they owed these laws and customs originally to the wide
extent of their arable land, and still more to the fact that their
lives were under the protection of religion; for, owing to the
Olympic assembly, their territory was especially exempted by
the Greeks from pillage; and they had accordingly been free
from all injury and hostile invasion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b4_74" id="b4_74"><b>74.</b></a> But in the course of time, when the Arcadians advanced
a claim for Lasion and the whole district of Pisa, <span class="sidenote">The ancient
privileges of Elis
lost.</span>
being
forced to defend their territory and change their
habits of life, they no longer troubled themselves
in the least about recovering from the
Greeks their ancient and ancestral immunity from pillage,
but were content to remain exactly as they were. This in my
opinion was a short-sighted policy. For peace is a thing we
all desire, and are willing to submit to anything to obtain: it is
the only one of our so-called blessings that no one questions. If
then there are people who, having the opportunity of obtaining
it, with justice and honour, from the Greeks, without question
and for perpetuity, neglect to do so, or regard other objects as
of superior importance to it, must we not look upon them as
undoubtedly blind to their true interests? But if it be objected
that, by adopting such a mode of life, they would become easily
open to attack and exposed to treachery: I answer that such
an event would be rare, and if it did happen, would be a claim
on the aid of united Greece; but that for minor injuries, having
all the wealth which unbroken peace would be sure to bring
them, they would never have been at a loss for foreign soldiers
or mercenaries to protect them at certain places and times. As
it is, from dread of what is occasional and unlikely, they involve
their country and property in perpetual wars and losses.</p>

<p>My object in thus speaking is to admonish the Eleans: for
they have never had a more favourable time than the present
to get back their ancient privilege of exemption from pillage,
which is universally acknowledged to belong to them. Even
now, some sparks, so to speak, of their old habit remaining,
Elis is more thickly populated than other districts.</p>

<p><a name="b4_75" id="b4_75"><b>75.</b></a> And therefore during Philip&#8217;s occupation of the country
the number of prisoners taken was immense; <span class="sidenote">Capture of
Thalamae.</span>
and the number of those who escaped by
flight still greater. An enormous amount of
movable property, and an enormous crowd of slaves and
cattle, were collected at a place called Thalamae; which was
selected for the purpose, because the approach to it was
narrow and difficult, and the place itself was retired and not
easy to enter. But when the king was informed of the number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
of those who had taken refuge in this place, resolved to
leave nothing unattempted or incomplete, he occupied certain
spots which commanded the approach to it, with his mercenaries:
while leaving his baggage and main army in his
entrenched camp, he himself led his peltasts and light-armed
troops through the gorge, and, without meeting with any resistance,
came directly under the fortress. The fugitives were
panic-stricken at his approach: for they were utterly inexperienced
in war and unprovided with means of defence,&mdash;a
mere rabble hurriedly collected together; they therefore at
once surrendered, and among them two hundred mercenary
soldiers, of various nationalities, who had been brought there by
Amphidamus the Elean Strategus. Having thus become
master of an immense booty in goods, and of more than five
thousand slaves, and having in addition to these driven off an
incalculable number of cattle, Philip now returned to his
camp; but finding his army overburdened with spoils of every
description, and rendered by that means cumbrous and useless
for service, he retraced his steps, and once more marched to
Olympia.</p>

<p><a name="b4_76" id="b4_76"><b>76.</b></a> But now a difficulty arose which was created by
Apelles. Apelles was one of those who had <span class="sidenote">Oppressive conduct
of Apelles to
the Achaeans.</span>
been left by Antigonus as guardians of his son,
and had, as it happened, more influence than
any one else with the king. He conceived the wish to bring
the Achaeans into the same position as the Thessalians; and
adopted for that purpose a very offensive line of conduct.
The Thessalians were supposed to enjoy their own constitution,
and to have quite a different status to the Macedonians; but
in fact they had exactly the same, and obeyed every order of
the royal ministers. It was with the purpose of bringing about
the same state of things, that this officer now set himself to test
the subservience of the Achaean contingent. At first he confined
himself to giving the Macedonian soldiers leave to
eject Achaeans from their quarters, who on any occasion had
taken possession of them first, as well as to wrest from them
any booty they might have taken; but he afterwards treated
them with actual violence, through the agency of his subordinates,
on any trifling pretext; while such as complained of this treatment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
or took the part of those who were being beaten, he
personally arrested and put into confinement: being convinced
that by this method he would gradually and imperceptibly
bring them into the habit of submitting, without remonstrance,
to any thing which the king might choose to inflict. And this
opinion he deduced from his previous experience in the army of
Antigonus, when he had seen the Achaeans willing to endure
any hardship, on the one condition of escaping from the yoke
of Cleomenes. However, certain young Achaeans held a
meeting, and going to Aratus explained to him the policy
which was being pursued by Apelles: whereupon Aratus at
once went to Philip, feeling that a stand must be made on
this point at once and without delay. He made his statement
to the king; who, being informed of the facts, first of
all encouraged the young men by a promise that nothing of
the sort should happen to them again; and then commanded
Apelles not to impose any orders upon the Achaeans without
consulting their own Strategus.</p>

<p><a name="b4_77" id="b4_77"><b>77.</b></a> Philip, then, was acquiring a great reputation, not only
among those actually in his army, <span class="sidenote">Character of
Philip V.</span>
but among
the other Peloponnesians also, for his behaviour
to the allies serving with him, as well as for his
ability and courage in the field. Indeed it would not be easy
to find a king endowed with more natural qualities requisite
for the acquisition of power. He had in an eminent degree
a quick understanding, a retentive memory, and a winning
grace of manner, joined to a look of royal dignity and
authority; and most important of all, ability and courage as
a general. What neutralised all these excellent qualities,
and made a cruel tyrant of a naturally well-disposed king, it is
not easy to say in a few words: and therefore that inquiry
must be reserved for a more suitable time than the present.</p>

<p>Starting from Olympia by the road leading to Pharae,
Philip came first to Telphusa, <span class="sidenote">Philip continues
his campaign.</span>
and thence to
Heraea. There he had the booty sold by
auction, and repaired the bridge over the
Alpheus, with the view of passing over it to the invasion of
Triphylia.</p>

<p>Just at that time the Aetolian Strategus, Dorimachus, in answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
to a request of the Eleans for protection against the devastation
they were enduring, despatched six hundred
Aetolians, <span class="sidenote">Arrival of
Aetolian troops
under Phillidas,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218.</span>
under the command of Phillidas, to
their aid. Having arrived in Elis, and taken over
the Elean mercenaries, who were five hundred
in number, as well as a thousand citizen soldiers and the Tarentine
cavalry,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> he marched to the relief of Triphylia. <span class="sidenote">Triphylia.</span>
This
district is so called from Triphylus, one of the
sons of Arcas, and lies on the coast of the
Peloponnese between Elis and Messenia, facing the Libyan
Sea, and touching the south-west frontier of Arcadia. It
contains the following towns, Samicum, Lepreum, Hypana,
Typaneae, Pyrgos, Aepium, Bolax, Stylangium, Phrixa; all of
which, shortly before this, the Eleans had conquered and annexed,
as well as the city of Alipheira, which had originally been
subject to Arcadia and Megalopolis, but had been exchanged
with the Eleans, for some private object of his own, by
Lydiadas when tyrant of Megalopolis.</p>

<p><a name="b4_78" id="b4_78"><b>78.</b></a> Phillidas, then, sent his Elean troops to Lepreum, and his
mercenaries to Aliphera; while he himself went with the Aetolian
troops to Typaneae, and waited to see what would happen.
Meanwhile the king, having got rid of his heavy baggage, and
crossed the bridge over the river Alpheus, which flows right
under Heraea, came to Alipheira, which lies on a hill precipitous
on every side, and the ascent of which is more than
ten stades. The citadel is on the very summit of this hill,
adorned with a colossal statue of Athene, of extraordinary size
and beauty. The origin and purpose of this statue, and at
whose expense it was set up, are doubtful questions even
among the natives; for it has never been clearly discovered
why or by whom it was dedicated: yet it is universally allowed
that its skilful workmanship classes it among the most splendid
and artistic productions of Hecatodorus<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> and Sostratus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning being fine and bright, the king made his
dispositions at daybreak. <span class="sidenote">Capture of Alipheira.</span>
He placed parties
of men with scaling ladders at several points,
and supported each of them with bodies of
mercenaries, and detachments of Macedonian hoplites, on
the rear of these several parties. His orders being fulfilled
with enthusiasm and a formidable display of power,
the garrison of Alipheira were kept continually rushing and
rallying to the particular spots to which they saw the Macedonians
approaching: and while this was going on, the king
himself took some picked men, and mounted unobserved
over some steep hills up to the suburb of the citadel; and
then, at a given signal, all at once put the scaling ladders to
the walls and began attempting the town. The king was the
first to take the suburb of the acropolis, which had been
abandoned by the garrison; and when this was set on fire,
those who were defending the town walls, foreseeing what must
happen, and afraid that by the fall of the citadel they would
be deprived of their last hope, abandoned the town walls, and
fled into it: whereupon the Macedonians at once took the
walls and the town. Subsequently the garrison on the citadel
sent an embassy to Philip, who granted them their lives, and
received possession of it also by formal surrender.</p>

<p><a name="b4_79" id="b4_79"><b>79.</b></a> These achievements of the king alarmed the whole
people of Triphylia, and made them take <span class="sidenote">Typanae and Phigalia
surrender
to Philip.</span>
counsel severally for the safety of themselves
and their respective cities: while Phillidas left
Typaneae, after plundering some of the houses there, and
retired to Lepreum. This was the reward which the allies
of the Aetolians at that time usually got: not only to be
deserted at the hour of utmost need in the most barefaced
way, but, by being plundered as well as betrayed, to suffer at
the hands of their allies exactly what they had a right to expect
from a victorious enemy. But the people of Typaneae surrendered
their city to Philip; as also did the inhabitants of
Hypana. And the people of Phigalia, hearing of what had
taken place in Triphylia, and disliking the alliance with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Aetolians, rose in arms and seized the space round the Polemarchium.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>
The Aetolian pirates who were residing in this
city, for the purpose of plundering Messene, were able at first
to keep down and overawe the people; but when they saw
that the whole town was mustering to the rescue, they desisted
from the attempt. Having made terms with them, they took
their baggage and evacuated the town; whereupon the inhabitants
sent an embassy to Philip, and delivered themselves
and their town into his hands.</p>

<p><a name="b4_80" id="b4_80"><b>80.</b></a> While these things were going on, the people of
Lepreum, having seized a certain quarter of
their town, <span class="sidenote">Lepreum.</span>
demanded that the Elean, Aetolian,
and Lacedaemonian garrisons (for a reinforcement had come
from Sparta also) should all alike evacuate the citadel and city.
At first Phillidas refused, and stayed on, hoping to overawe
the citizens; but when the king, despatching Taurion with
a guard of soldiers to Phigalia, advanced in person towards
Lepreum, and was now close to the town, Phillidas lowered
his tone, and the Lepreates were encouraged in their determination.
It was indeed a glorious act of gallantry on their part.
Though there was a garrison within their walls of a thousand
Eleans, a thousand Aetolians with the pirates, five hundred
mercenaries, and two hundred Lacedaemonians, and though
too their citadel was in the occupation of these troops, yet
they ventured to make a stand for the freedom of their
native city, and would not give up hope of deliverance.
Phillidas therefore, seeing that the Lepreates were prepared to
offer a stout resistance, and that the Macedonians were
approaching, evacuated the town with the Eleans and Lacedaemonians.
The Cretans, who had been sent by the Spartans,
made their way home through Messenia; but Phillidas departed
for Samicum. The people of Lepreum, having thus got
control of their own town, sent ambassadors to place it in the
power of Philip. Hearing the news, Philip sent all his army,
except the peltasts and light-armed troops, to Lepreum; and
taking the latter with him, he made all the haste he could to
catch Phillidas. He succeeded so far as to capture all his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
baggage; but Phillidas himself managed to outstrip him and
throw himself into Samicum. <span class="sidenote">Samicum,</span>
The king therefore
sat down before this place: and having
sent for the rest of his army from Lepreum, made the garrison
believe that he meant to besiege the town. But the
Aetolians and Eleans within it, having nothing ready for
sustaining a siege beyond their bare hands, alarmed at their
situation, held a parley with Philip to secure their lives;
and having obtained leave from him to march out with their
arms, they departed into Elis. Thus the king became master
of Samicum on the spot: and this was followed by deputations
from other towns to him, with entreaties for protection; in
virtue of which he took over Phrixa, Stylangium, <span class="sidenote">and other towns.</span>
Aepium, Bolax, Pyrgos, and Epitalium.
Having settled these things, and reduced all Triphylia into
his power in six days, he returned to Lepreum; and having
addressed the necessary warnings to the Lepreates, and put a
garrison into the citadel, he departed with his army towards
Heraea, leaving Ladicus of Acarnania in command of Triphylia.
When he arrived at Heraea, he made a distribution of all the
booty; and taking up again his baggage from Heraea, arrived
about the middle of the winter at Megalopolis.</p>

<p><a name="b4_81" id="b4_81"><b>81.</b></a> While Philip was thus engaged in Triphylia, Chilon
the Lacedaemonian, holding that the kingship
belonged to him in virtue of birth, <span class="sidenote">Chilon tries to
seize the crown of
Sparta,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218.</span>
and annoyed
at the neglect of his claims by the Ephors
in selecting Lycurgus, determined to stir up a revolution:
and believing that if he took the same course as Cleomenes
had done, and gave the common people hopes of land
allotments and redivision of property, the masses would quickly
follow him, he addressed himself to carrying out this policy.
Having therefore agreed with his friends on this subject, and
got as many as two hundred people to join his conspiracy,
he entered upon the execution of his project. But perceiving
that the chief obstacles in the way of the accomplishment
of his design were Lycurgus, and those Ephors who had invested
him with the crown, he directed his first efforts against them.
The Ephors he seized while at dinner, and put them all to
death on the spot,&mdash;chance thus inflicting upon them the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
punishment they deserved: for whether we regard the person
at whose hands, or the person for whose sake they were thus
destroyed, we cannot but say that they richly merited their
fate.</p>

<p>After the successful accomplishment of this deed, Chilon
went to the house of Lycurgus, whom he found at home, but
failed to seize. Assisted by slaves and neighbours Lycurgus
was smuggled out of the house, and effected a secret escape;
and thence got away by a cross-country route to the town of
Pellene in Tripolis. Thus baffled in the most important point
of his enterprise, Chilon was greatly discouraged; but was
forced all the same to go on with what he had begun.
Accordingly he made a descent upon the market-place, and laid
violent hands upon those opposed to him; tried to rouse his
relations and friends; and declared to the rest of the people
there what hopes of success he had. But when nobody seemed
inclined to join him, but on the contrary a mob began to
collect with threatening looks, he saw how it was, and found a
secret way of leaving the town; and, making his way across
Laconia, arrived in Achaia alone and an exile. But the
Lacedaemonians who were in the territory of Megalopolis,
terrified by the arrival of Philip, stowed away all the goods
they had got from the country, and first demolished and
then abandoned the Athenaeum.</p>

<p>The fact is that the Lacedaemonians enjoyed a most
excellent constitution, and had a most extensive <span class="sidenote">Decline of
Sparta.</span>
power, from the time of the legislation
of Lycurgus to that of the battle of Leuctra.
But after that event their fortune took an unfavourable turn;
and their political state continued ever growing
worse and worse, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;800(?)-<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
371.</span>
until they finally suffered
from a long succession of internal
struggles and partisan warfare; were repeatedly agitated
by schemes for the redivision of lands and the banishment
of one party or another; and were subjected to the
severest possible slavery, culminating in the tyrannical government
of Nabis: though the word &#8220;tyrant&#8221; was one which
they had in old times scarcely endured to hear mentioned.
However, the ancient history of Sparta as well as the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
part of it since, has been recorded by many in terms of eulogy
or the reverse; but the part of that history <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;236-222.</span>
which admits of the least controversy is that
which followed the entire destruction of the ancient constitution
by Cleomenes;<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> and that shall be narrated by me
in the order of events as they occur.</p>

<p><a name="b4_82" id="b4_82"><b>82.</b></a> Meanwhile Philip left Megalopolis, and marching by
way of Tegea arrived at Argos, and there spent
the rest of the winter, <span class="sidenote">Apelles opposes
Aratus, Jan.-May,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218.</span>
having gained in this
campaign an admiration beyond his years for his
general conduct and his brilliant achievements. But, in spite
of all that had happened, Apelles was by no means inclined to
desist from the policy on which he had entered; but was
resolved little by little to bring the Achaeans under the
yoke. He saw that the most determined opponents of his
scheme were the elder and younger Aratus; and that Philip
was inclined to listen to them, and especially to the elder,
both on account of his former intimacy with Antigonus,
and his pre-eminent influence in Achaia, and, most of all,
because of his readiness of resource and practical ability: he
therefore determined to devote his attention to them, and
enter upon the intrigue against them which I shall proceed to
describe. He sought out in the several cities all such as were
opposed to Aratus, and invited them to visit him: and having
got them into his hands he tried all he could to win their
affections, encouraged them to look upon him as a friend,
and introduced them to Philip. To the king he was always
pointing out that, if he listened to Aratus, he would have to
treat the Achaeans according to the letter of the treaty of
alliance; but that, if he would listen to him, and take men like
those which he had introduced to him into favour, he would
have the whole of the Peloponnese at his own unfettered disposal.
But what he was most anxious about was the election; being
desirous to secure the office of Strategus for one of this party,
and to oust Aratus in accordance with his settled plan. <span class="sidenote">May, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218.</span>With
this purpose, he persuaded Philip to be at
Aegium at the time of the Achaean election, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
the pretext of being on his way to Elis. The king&#8217;s consent to
this enabled Apelles himself to be there at the right time; <span class="sidenote">Election of
Eperatus as
Achaean
Strategus.</span>
and
though he found great difficulty, in spite of
entreaties and threats, in carrying his point; yet
he did eventually succeed in getting Eperatus
of Pharae elected Strategus, and Timoxenus, the
candidate proposed by Aratus, rejected.</p>

<p><a name="b4_83" id="b4_83"><b>83.</b></a> This over, the king departed by way of Patrae and
Dyme, and arrived with his army before the
fortress called the Wall, <span class="sidenote">Capture of the
Wall, and
expedition into
Elis.</span>
which is situated on
the frontier of the territory of Dyme, and had
a short time before, as I mentioned above,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> been
occupied by Euripidas. The king, being anxious at all hazards
to recover this place for the Dymaeans, encamped under its
walls with his full force: and thereupon the Elean garrison in
alarm surrendered the place to Philip, which, though not large,
had been fortified with extraordinary care. For though the
circumference of its walls was not more than a stade and a
half, its height was nowhere less than thirty cubits. Having
handed the place over to the Dymaeans, Philip continued
his advance, plundering the territory of Elis: and when he had
thoroughly devastated it, and acquired a large booty, he
returned with his army to Dyme.</p>

<p><a name="b4_84" id="b4_84"><b>84.</b></a> Meanwhile Apelles, thinking that, by the election
of the Achaean Strategus through his influence, <span class="sidenote">The intrigue of
Apelles.</span>
he had partly succeeded in his policy, began
once more attacking Aratus, with the view of
entirely detaching Philip from his friendship: and he accordingly
determined to make up an accusation against him
grounded on the following circumstance: When Amphidamus,
the Elean Strategus, had been, with the other refugees, made
prisoner at Thalamae, and had been brought among other
captives to Olympia, he made earnest efforts by the agency
of certain individuals to be allowed an interview with the
king. This favour having been accorded him, he made a
statement to the effect that it was in his power to bring over
the Eleans to the king&#8217;s side, and induce them to enter into
alliance with him. Philip believed him; and accordingly dismissed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Amphidamus without ransom, with instructions to
promise the Eleans, that, if they would join the king, he would
restore their captive citizens without ransom, and would himself
secure their territory safely from all outside attacks: and
besides this would maintain them in freedom, without impost
or foreign garrison, and in enjoyment of their several constitutions.</p>

<p>But the Eleans refused to listen to the proposal, although
the offer was thought attractive and substantial. Apelles
therefore used this circumstance to found the false accusation
which he now brought before Philip, alleging that Aratus was
not a loyal friend to the Macedonians, nor sincere in his
feelings towards them: &#8220;He was responsible for this alienation
of the Eleans; for when the king despatched Amphidamus
from Olympia into Elis, Aratus took him aside and talked to
him, asserting that it was by no means to the interest of the
Peloponnesians that Philip should become supreme in Elis:
and this was the reason of the Eleans despising the king&#8217;s offers,
and clinging to the friendship of the Aetolians, and persisting
in war against the Macedonians.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b4_85" id="b4_85"><b>85.</b></a> Regarding the matter as important, the first step the
king took was to summon the elder and
younger Aratus, <span class="sidenote">The king investigates
the charge
against Aratus.</span>
and order Apelles to repeat
these assertions in their presence: which he
thereupon did in a bold and threatening tone. And upon
the king still not saying a word, he added: &#8220;Since his
Majesty finds you, Aratus, so ungrateful and so exceedingly
adverse to his interests, he is determined to summon a meeting
of the Achaeans, and, after making a statement of his reasons,
forthwith to return to Macedonia.&#8221; Aratus the elder answered
him with a general exhortation to Philip, never to give a hasty or
inconsiderate credit to any thing which might be alleged before
him against his friends and allies: but when any such allegation
were made, to test its truth before accepting it; for that was
the conduct which became a king, and was in every way to his
interest. Wherefore he said, &#8220;I claim that you should, in the
present instance of these accusations of Apelles, summon those
who heard my words; and openly produce the man that
informed Apelles of them, and omit no means of ascertaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
the real truth, before making any statement in regard to these
matters to the Achaeans.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b4_86" id="b4_86"><b>86.</b></a> The king approved of this speech, and said that he
would not neglect the matter, but would thoroughly investigate
it. And so for the present the audience was dissolved. But
during the following days, while Apelles failed to bring any
proof of his allegations, <span class="sidenote">Aratus is
cleared.</span>
Aratus was favoured
by the following combination of circumstances.
While Philip was laying waste their territory,
the Eleans, suspecting Amphidamus of treachery, determined
to arrest him and send him in chains to Aetolia. But getting
intelligence of their purpose, he escaped first to Olympia;
and there, hearing that Philip was at Dyme engaged in the
division of his spoils, he followed him to that town in great
haste. When Aratus heard that Amphidamus had been driven
from Elis and was come to Dyme, he was delighted, because
his conscience was quite clear in the matter; and going to the
king demanded that he should summon Amphidamus to his
presence; on the ground that the man to whom the words
were alleged to have been spoken would best know about
the accusations, and would declare the truth; for he had become
an exile from his home from Philip&#8217;s sake, and had now
no hope of safety except in him. These arguments satisfied
the king, who thereupon sent for Amphidamus and ascertained
that the accusation was false. The result was that from that day
forward his liking and respect for Aratus continually increased,
while he began to regard Apelles with suspicion; though being
still under the influence of his old ascendency, he was compelled
to connive at many of his actions.</p>

<p><a name="b4_87" id="b4_87"><b>87.</b></a> Apelles however by no means abandoned his policy. He
began undermining the position of Taurion also, who had been
placed in command of the Peloponnese by Antigonus, not indeed
openly attacking him, but rather praising his character,
and asserting that he was a proper person to be with the king on
a campaign; his object being to get some one else appointed
to conduct the government of the Peloponnese. This was
indeed a novel method of defamation,&mdash;to damage one&#8217;s neighbours,
not by attacking, but by praising their characters; and
this method of wreaking one&#8217;s malice, envy, and treachery may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
be regarded as primarily and specially the invention of the
jealousy and selfish ambition of courtiers. In the same spirit
he began making covert attacks upon Alexander, the captain of
the bodyguard, whenever he got an opportunity; being bent
on reconstituting by his own authority even the personal
attendants of the king, and on making a clean sweep of all
arrangements left existing by Antigonus. For as in his life
Antigonus had managed his kingdom and his son with wisdom,
so at his death he made wise provisions for every department
of the State. For in his will he explained to the Macedonians
the nature of these arrangements; and also gave definite
instructions for the future, how and by whom each of these
arrangements was to be carried out: being desirous of leaving
no vantage-ground to the courtiers for mutual rivalry and
strife. Among these arrangements was one selecting Apelles
from among his companions in arms to be one of the guardians
of his son; Leontius to command the peltasts; Megaleas to be
chief secretary; Taurion to be governor of the Peloponnese;
and Alexander to be captain of the bodyguard. Apelles had
already got Leontius and Megaleas completely under his influence:
and he was now desirous to remove Alexander and
Taurion from their offices, and so to control these, as well as
all other departments of the government, by the agency of his
own friends. And he would have easily succeeded in doing
so, had he not raised up an opponent in the person of Aratus.
As it was, he quickly reaped the fruits of his own blind
selfishness and ambition; for that which he purposed inflicting
on his neighbours he had to endure himself, and that within
a very brief space. How and by what means this was brought
about, I must forbear to tell for the present, and must bring
this book to an end: but in subsequent parts of my work I
will endeavour to make every detail of these transactions
clear.</p>

<p>For the present, after concluding the business which I have
described, Philip returned to Argos, and there spent the rest
of the winter season with his friends, while he sent back his
forces to Macedonia.</p>

now come to an end with the rising of the

for that was the arrangement of
time then observed by the Achaeans.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> Accordingly he laid
down his office and was succeeded in the command of the
Achaeans by Eperatus; Dorimachus being still Strategus of
the Aetolians.</p>

<p>It was at the beginning of this summer that Hannibal entered
upon open war with Rome; started from New Carthage; and
crossing the Iber, definitely began his expedition and march
into Italy; while the Romans despatched Tiberius Sempronius
to Libya with an army, and Publius Cornelius to Iberia.</p>

<p>This year, too, Antiochus and Ptolemy, abandoning
diplomacy, and the support of their mutual claims upon Coele-Syria
by negotiation, began actual war with each other.</p>

<p>As for Philip, being in need of corn and money for his
army, he summoned the Achaeans to a general
assembly by means of their magistrates. <span class="sidenote">Recognition of
Philip&#8217;s services

When
the assembly had met, according to the federal
law, at Aegium,<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> the king saw that Aratus and
his son were indisposed to act for him, because
of the intrigues against them in the matter of the election,
which had been carried on by Apelles; and that Eperatus was
naturally inefficient, and an object of general contempt. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>facts convinced the king of the folly of Apelles and Leontius,
and he once more decided to stand by Aratus. He therefore
persuaded the magistrates to transfer the assembly to Sicyon;
and there inviting both the elder and younger Aratus to an
interview, he laid the blame of all that had happened upon
Apelles, and urged them to maintain their original policy.
Receiving a ready consent from them, he then entered the
Achaean assembly, and being energetically supported by these
two statesmen, earned all the measures that he desired. For
the Achaeans passed a vote decreeing &#8220;that five hundred talents
should be paid to the king at once for his last campaign, that
three months&#8217; pay should be given to his army, and ten
thousand medimni of corn; and that, for the future, so long
as the king should remain in the Peloponnese as their ally in
the war, he should receive seventeen talents a month from the
Achaeans.</p>

<p><a name="b5_2" id="b5_2"><b>2.</b></a> Having passed this decree, the Achaeans dispersed to
their various cities. And now the king&#8217;s forces
mustered again from their winter quarters; <span class="sidenote">The king prepares

and
after deliberations with his friends, Philip
decided to transfer the war to the sea. For he had become
convinced that it was only by so doing that he would himself
be able to surprise the enemy at all points at once, and would
best deprive them of the opportunity of coming to each others&#8217;
relief; as they were widely scattered, and each would be in
alarm for their own safety, because the approach of an enemy
by sea is so silent and rapid. For he was at war with three
separate nations,&mdash;Aetolians, Lacedaemonians, and Eleans.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this decision, he ordered the ships of
the Achaeans as well as his own to muster at Lechaeum; and
there he made continual experiments in practising the soldiers
of the phalanx to the use of the oar. The Macedonians
answered to his instructions with ready enthusiasm: for they
are in fact the most gallant soldiers on the field of battle, the
promptest to undertake service at sea if need be, and the
most laborious workers at digging trenches, making palisades,
and all such engineering work, in the world: just such as
Hesiod describes the Aeacidae to be</p>

remained in Corinth, busied with these practisings
and preparations for taking the sea. <span class="sidenote">Fresh intrigue of

But
Apelles, being neither able to retain an ascendency
over Philip, nor to submit to the loss of influence which
resulted from this disregard, entered into a conspiracy with
Leontius and Megaleas, by which it was agreed that these two
men should stay on the spot and damage the king&#8217;s service by
deliberate neglect; while he went to Chalcis, and contrived
that no supplies should be brought the king from thence for the
promotion of his designs. Having made this arrangement and
mischievous stipulation with these two men, Apelles set out
for Chalcis, having found some false pretexts to satisfy the king
as to his departure. And while protracting his stay there, he
carried out his sworn agreement with such determination, that,
as all men obeyed him because of this former credit, the king was
at last reduced by want of money to pawn some of the silver-plate
used at his own table, to carry on his affairs. <span class="sidenote">Philip starts on

However, when the ships were all collected, and

army, put to sea, and arrived at Patrae on the second day, with
six thousand Macedonians and twelve hundred mercenaries.</p>

sent Agelaus and Scopas with five hundred Neo-Cretans<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> into
Elis; while the Eleans, in fear of Philip&#8217;s attempting the siege
of Cyllene, were collecting mercenaries, preparing their own
citizens, and carefully strengthening the defences of Cyllene.
When Philip saw what was going on, he stationed a force at
Dyme, consisting of the Achaean mercenaries, some of the
Cretans serving with him, and some of the Gallic horse,
together with two thousand picked Achaean infantry. These he
left there as a reserve, as well as an advance guard to prevent
the danger of an attack from Elis; while he himself, having
first written to the Acarnanians and Scerdilaidas, that each of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
their towns should man such vessels as they had and meet him
at Cephallenia, put to sea from Patrae at the time arranged, and
arrived off Pronni in Cephallenia. But when he saw that this
fortress was difficult to besiege, and its position a contracted
one, he coasted past it with his fleet and came
to anchor at Palus. <span class="sidenote">The siege of
Palus.</span>
Finding that the country
there was full of corn and capable of supporting
an army, he disembarked his troops and encamped close to
the city: and having beached his ships close together, secured
them with a trench and palisade, and sent out his Macedonian
soldiers to forage. He himself made a personal inspection of the
town, to see how he could bring his siege-works and artillery to
bear upon the wall. He wished to be able to use the place as a
rendezvous for his allies; but he was also desirous of taking it:
first, because he would thereby deprive the Aetolians of their
most useful support,&mdash;for it was by means of Cephallenian
ships that they made their descents upon the Peloponnese, and
ravaged the sea-boards of Epirus and Acarnania,&mdash;and,
secondly, that he might secure for himself and his allies a
convenient base of operations against the enemy&#8217;s territory.
For Cephallenia lies exactly opposite the Corinthian Gulf, in
the direction of the Sicilian Sea, and commands the north-western
district of the Peloponnese, and especially Elis; as well
as the south-western parts of Epirus, Aetolia, and Acarnania.</p>

<p><a name="b5_4" id="b5_4"><b>4.</b></a> The excellent position, therefore, of the island, both as
a rendezvous for the allies and as a base of attack against the
hostile, or of defence for the friendly, territory, made the king
very anxious to get it into his power. His survey of the town
showed him that it was entirely defended by the sea and steep
hills, except for a short distance in the direction of Zacynthus,
where the ground was flat; and he accordingly resolved to
erect his works and concentrate his attack at that spot.</p>

<p>While the king was engaged in these operations fifty galleys
arrived from Scerdilaidas, who had been prevented <span class="sidenote">Arrival of the
allies at Palus.</span>
from sending more by the plots and
civil broils throughout Illyria, caused by the
despots of the various cities. There arrived also the appointed
contingents of allies from Epirus, Acarnania, and even
Messenia; for the Messenians had ceased to excuse themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
from taking part in the war ever since the capture of
Phigalia.
Having now made his arrangements for the siege, and
having got his catapults and ballistae in
position to annoy the defenders on the walls, <span class="sidenote">The walls are
undermined and
a breach made.
Leontius plays
the traitor.</span>
the king harangued his Macedonian troops, and,
bringing his siege-machines up to the walls,
began under their protection to sink mines.
The Macedonians worked with such enthusiastic eagerness
that in a short time two hundred feet of the wall were undermined
and underpinned: and the king then approached the
walls and invited the citizens to come to terms. Upon their
refusal, he set fire to the props, and thus brought down
the whole part of the wall that rested upon them simultaneously.
Into this breach he first sent his peltasts under the
command of Leontius, divided into cohorts, and with orders
to force their way over the ruin. But Leontius, in fulfilment of
his compact with Apelles, three times running prevented the
soldiers, even after they had carried the breach, from effecting
the capture of the town. He had corrupted beforehand the
most important officers of the several cohorts; and he himself
deliberately affected fear, and shrunk from every service of danger;
and finally they were ejected from the town with considerable
loss, although they could have mastered the enemy with
ease. When the king saw that the officers were behaving with
cowardice, and that a considerable number of the Macedonian
soldiers were wounded, he abandoned the siege, and deliberated
with his friends on the next step to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="b5_5" id="b5_5"><b>5.</b></a> Meanwhile Lycurgus had invaded Messenia; and Dorimachus
had started for Thessaly with half the <span class="sidenote">Ambassadors
from Acarnania
urge Philip to
invade Aetolia;
others from
Messenia beg him
to come there.</span>
Aetolian army,&mdash;both with the idea that they
would thus draw off Philip from the siege of
Palus. Presently ambassadors arrived at the
court to make representations on these subjects
from Acarnania and Messenia: the former
urging Philip to prevent Dorimachus&#8217;s invasion of Macedonia
by himself invading Aetolia, and traversing and plundering the
whole country while there was no one to resist him; the latter
begged him to come to their assistance, representing that in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
existing state of the Etesian winds the passage from Cephallenia
to Messenia could be effected in a single day, whereby,
so Gorgus of Messenia and his colleagues argued, a sudden
and effective attack would be made upon Lycurgus. In
pursuance of his policy Leontius eagerly supported Gorgus,
seeing that by this means Philip would absolutely waste the
summer. For it was easy enough to sail to Messenia; but to
sail back again, while the Etesian winds prevailed, was impossible.
It was plain therefore that Philip would get shut up
in Messenia with his army, and remain inactive for what
remained of the summer; while the Aetolians would traverse
Thessaly and Epirus and plunder them at their pleasure.
Such was the insidious nature of the advice given by Gorgus
and Leontius. But Aratus, who was present, advocated an
exactly opposite policy, urging the king to sail to Aetolia and
devote himself to that part of the campaign: for as the
Aetolians had gone on an expedition across the frontier under
Dorimachus, it was a most excellent opportunity for invading
and plundering Aetolia. <span class="sidenote">Philip decides on
the invasion of
Aetolia.</span>
The king had begun
to entertain distrust of Leontius since his
exhibition of cowardice in the siege; and had
detected his dishonesty in the course of the discussions held
about Palus: he therefore decided to act in the present
instance in accordance with the opinion of Aratus. Accordingly
he wrote to the Achaean Strategus Eperatus, bidding him
take the Achaean levies, and go to the aid of the Messenians;
while he himself put to sea from Cephallenia, and arrived at
night after a two days&#8217; voyage at Leucas: and having managed
by proper contrivances to get his ships through the channel
of Dioryctus,<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> he sailed up the Ambracian Gulf, which, as I
have already stated,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> stretches from the Sicilian Sea a long
distance into the interior of Aetolia. Having made the whole
length of this gulf, and anchored a short time before daybreak
at Limnaea, he ordered his men to get their breakfast, and
leaving the greater part of their baggage behind them, to make
themselves ready in light equipment for a march; while he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>himself collected the guides, and made careful inquiries of
them about the country and neighbouring towns.</p>

<p><a name="b5_6" id="b5_6"><b>6.</b></a> Before they started, Aristophanes the Acarnanian
Strategus arrived with the full levy of his people. <span class="sidenote">Philip is joined
by the
Acarnanians, and
marches to the
Achelous.</span>
For having in former times suffered many severe
injuries at the hands of the Aetolians, they were
now inspired with a fierce determination to be
revenged upon them and damage them in every
possible way: they gladly therefore seized this opportunity
of getting the help of the Macedonians; and the men who now
appeared in arms were not confined to those forced by law to
serve, but were in some cases past the military age. The
Epirotes were quite as eager to join, and for the same motives;
but owing to the wide extent of their country, and the
suddenness of the Macedonian arrival, they had not been able
to muster their forces in time. As to the Aetolians, Dorimachus
had taken half their army with him, as I have said, while the
the other half he had left at home, thinking that it would be
an adequate reserve to defend the towns and district against
unforeseen contingencies. The king, leaving a sufficient guard
for his baggage, started from Limnaea in the evening, and after
a march of sixty stades pitched his camp: but, having dined
and given his men a short rest, he started again; and marching
right through the night, arrived just as the day was breaking
at the river Achelous, between the towns of Stratus and
Conope, being anxious that his entrance into the district of
Thermus should be sudden and unexpected.</p>

<p><a name="b5_7" id="b5_7"><b>7.</b></a> Leontius saw that it was likely that the king would attain
his object, and the Aetolians be unable to
resist him, <span class="sidenote">Leontius tries to
hinder the
march.</span>
for the double reason of the speed
and unexpectedness of the Macedonian attack,
and of his having gone to Thermus; for the Aetolians would
never suppose him likely to venture to expose himself so
rashly, seeing the strongly fortified nature of the country,
and would therefore be sure to be caught off their guard and
wholly unprepared for the danger. Clinging still to his
purpose, therefore, he advised the king to encamp on the
Achelous, and rest his army after their night&#8217;s march; being
anxious to give the Aetolians a short respite to make preparations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
for their defence. But Aratus, seeing clearly that the
opportunity for action was fleeting, and that Leontius was
plainly trying to hinder their success, conjured Philip not to
let slip the opportunity by delaying.</p>

<p>The king was now thoroughly annoyed with Leontius: and
accepting the advice of Aratus, continued his
march without interruption; <span class="sidenote">The king crosses
the Achelous and
advances against
Thermus.</span>and, after crossing
the Achelous, advanced rapidly upon Thermus,
plundering and devastating the country as he
went, and marching so as to keep Stratus, Agrinium, and
Thestia on his left, Conope, Lysimachia, Trichonium, and
Phytaeum on his right. Arrived at the town of Metapa, which
is on the borders of the Trichonian Lake, and close to the
narrow pass along it, about sixty stades from Thermus, he
found it abandoned by the Aetolians, and occupied it with a
detachment of five hundred men, with a view of its serving as
a fortress to secure both ends of the pass: for the whole shore
of the lake is mountainous and rugged, closely fringed with
forest, and therefore affording but a narrow and difficult path.
He now arranged his order of march, putting the mercenaries
in the van, next them the Illyrians, and then the peltasts and
the men of the phalanx, and thus advanced through the pass;
his rear protected by the Cretans: while the Thracians and
light-armed troops took a different line of country, parallel to
his own, and kept up with him on his right: his left being
secured by the lake for nearly thirty stades.</p>

<p><a name="b5_8" id="b5_8"><b>8.</b></a> At the end of this distance he arrived at the village of
Pamphia; and having, as in the case of Panapa, secured it by
a guard, he continued his advance towards Thermus: the road
now being not only steep and exceedingly rough, but with
deep precipices also on either side, so as to make the path in
places very dangerous and narrow; and the whole ascent being
nearly thirty stades. But having accomplished this also in a
short time, thanks to the energy with which the Macedonians
conducted the march, he arrived late in the day at Thermus.
There he pitched a camp, <span class="sidenote">The plundering of
Thermus.</span>
and allowed his men to go off
plundering the neighbouring villages and
scouring the plain of Thermus, as well as to
sack the dwelling-houses in Thermus itself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
which were full, not only of corn and such like provisions, but
of all the most valuable property which the Aetolians
possessed. For as the annual fair and most famous games, as
well as the elections, were held there, everybody kept their most
costly possessions in store at Thermus, to enable them to entertain
their friends, and to celebrate the festivals with proper
magnificence. But besides this occasion for the employment
of their property, they expected to find the most complete
security for it there, because no enemy had ever yet ventured
to penetrate to that place; while its natural strength was so
great as to serve as an acropolis to the whole of Aetolia. The
place therefore having been in the enjoyment of peace from
time immemorial, not only were the buildings immediately round
the temple filled with a great variety of property, but the
homesteads on the outskirts also. For that night the army
bivouacked on the spot laden with booty of every description;
but the next morning they selected the most valuable and
portable part of it, and making the rest into a heap in front of
their tents, set fire to it. So also in regard to the dedicated
arms which were hanging up in the porticoes,&mdash;those of them
which were valuable they took down and carried off, some
they exchanged for their own, while the rest they collected
together and burnt. The number of these was more than
fifteen thousand.</p>

<p><a name="b5_9" id="b5_9"><b>9.</b></a> Up to this point everything was right and fair by the
laws of war; but I do not know how to
characterise their next proceedings. <span class="sidenote">Sacrilege
committed at
Thermus. Was it
justifiable?</span>
For remembering
what the Aetolians had done at
Dium<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> and Dodona,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> they burnt the colonnades,
and destroyed what were left of the dedicated offerings, some
of which were of costly material, and had been elaborated with
great skill and expense. And they were not content with
destroying the roofs of these buildings with fire, they levelled
them to their foundations; and threw down all the statues, which
numbered no less than two thousand; and many of them they
broke to pieces, sparing only those that were inscribed with
the names or figures of gods. Such they did abstain from
injuring. On the walls also they wrote the celebrated line composed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
by Samus, the son of Chrysogonus, a foster-brother of
the king, whose genius was then beginning to manifest itself.
The line was this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Seest thou the path the bolt divine has sped?&#8220;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And in fact the king and his staff were fully convinced that, in
thus acting, they were obeying the dictates of right and
justice, by retaliating upon the Aetolians with the same
impious outrages as they had themselves committed at Dium.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>
But I am clearly of an opposite opinion. And the readiest
argument, to prove the correctness of my view, may be drawn
from the history of this same royal family of Macedonia.</p>

<p>For when Antigonus, by his victory in a pitched battle over
Cleomenes the King of the Lacedaemonians, had become master
of Sparta, and had it absolutely in his own power to treat the
town and its citizens as he chose, he was so far from doing
any injury to those who had thus fallen into his hands, that
he did not return to his own country until he had bestowed
upon the Lacedaemonians, collectively and individually, some
benefits of the utmost importance. The consequence was
that he was honoured at the time with the title of &#8220;Benefactor,&#8221;
and after his death with that of &#8220;Preserver&#8221;; and not only
among the Lacedaemonians, but among the Greeks generally,
has obtained undying honour and glory.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p><a name="b5_10" id="b5_10"><b>10.</b></a> Take again the case of Philip, the founder of the
family splendour, and the first of the race to establish the
greatness of the kingdom. The success which he obtained,
after his victory over the Athenians at Chaeronea, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;338.</span>
was not due so much to his superiority
in arms, as to his justice and humanity. His victory in
the field gave him the mastery only over those immediately
engaged against him; while his equity and moderation
secured his hold upon the entire Athenian people and
their city. For he did not allow his measures to be dictated
by vindictive passion; but laid aside his arms and warlike
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>measures, as soon as he found himself in a position to display
the mildness of his temper and the uprightness of his motives.
With this view he dismissed his Athenian prisoners without
ransom, and took measures for the burial of those who had
fallen, and, by the agency of Antipater, caused their bones to
be conveyed home; and presented most of those whom he
released with suits of clothes. And thus, at small expense, his
prudence gained him a most important advantage. The
pride of the Athenians was not proof against such magnanimity;
and they became his zealous supporters, instead of antagonists,
in all his schemes.</p>

<p>Again in the case of Alexander the Great. He was so
enraged with the Thebans that he sold all the <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;335.</span>
inhabitants of the town into slavery, and
levelled the city itself with the ground; yet in making
its capture he was careful not to outrage religion, and
took the utmost precautions against even involuntary damage
being done to the temples, or any part of their sacred enclosures.
Once more, when he crossed into Asia, to
avenge on the Persians the impious outrages which they
had inflicted on the Greeks, he did his best to exact the
full penalty from men, but refrained from injuring places
dedicated to the gods; though it was in precisely such that the
injuries of the Persians in Greece had been most conspicuous.
These were the precedents which Philip should have called to
mind on this occasion; and so have shown himself the
successor and heir of these men,&mdash;not so much of their power,
as of their principles and magnanimity. But throughout his
life he was exceedingly anxious to establish his relationship
to Alexander and Philip, <span class="sidenote">The subsequent
decline in Philip&#8217;s
character.</span>and yet took not the
least pains to imitate them. The result was
that, as he advanced in years, as his conduct
differed from theirs, so his general reputation came to
be different also.</p>

<p><a name="b5_11" id="b5_11"><b>11.</b></a> The present affair was an instance of this. He
imagined that he was doing nothing wrong in giving the rein
to his anger, and retaliating upon the impious acts of the
Aetolians by similar impieties, and &#8220;curing ill by ill&#8221;; and
while he was always reproaching Scopas and Dorimachus with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
depravity and abandoned wickedness, on the grounds of their
acts of impiety at Dodona and Dium, he imagined that, while
emulating their crimes, he would leave quite a different
impression of his character in the minds of those to whom he
spoke. But the fact is, that whereas the taking and demolishing
an enemy&#8217;s forts, harbours, cities, men, ships and crops, and
other such things, by which our enemy is weakened, and our
own interests and tactics supported, are necessary acts
according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples,
statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness, and without
any prospect of strengthening oneself or weakening the enemy,
must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.
For the purpose with which good men wage war is not the
destruction and annihilation of the wrongdoers, but the
reformation and alteration of the wrongful acts. Nor is it
their object to involve the innocent in the destruction of the
guilty, but rather to see that those who are held to be guilty should
share in the preservation and elevation of the guiltless. It is the
act of a tyrant to inflict injury, and so to maintain his power
over unwilling subjects by terror,&mdash;hated, and hating those
under him: but it is the glory of a king to secure, by doing
good to all, that he should rule over willing subjects, whose
love he has earned by humanity and beneficence.</p>

<p>But the best way of appreciating the gravity of Philip&#8217;s
mistake is to put before our eyes the idea which <span class="sidenote">The error of such
sacrilege as a
matter of policy.</span>
the Aetolians would probably have conceived of
him, had he acted in an opposite way, and destroyed
neither colonnades nor statutes, nor done injury to any
of the sacred offerings. For my part I think it would have
been one of the greatest goodness and humanity. For they
would have had on their consciences their own acts at Dium
and Dodona; and would have seen unmistakably that,
whereas Philip was absolutely master of the situation, and
could do what he chose, and would have been held fully
justified as far as their deserts went in taking the severest
measures, yet deliberately, from mere gentleness and magnanimity,
he refused to copy their conduct in any respect.</p>

<p><a name="b5_12" id="b5_12"><b>12.</b></a> Clearly these considerations would most probably
have led them to condemn themselves, and to view Philip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
with respect and admiration for his kingly and high minded
qualities, shown by his respect for religion and by the moderation
of his anger against themselves. For in truth to
conquer one&#8217;s enemies in integrity and equity is not of less,
but of greater, practical advantage than victories in the field.
In the one case the defeated party yields under compulsion;
in the other with cheerful assent. In the one case the victor
effects his reformation at the cost of great losses; in the other
he recalls the erring to better courses without any damage to
himself. But above all, in the one case the chief credit of the
victory belongs to the soldiers, in the other it falls wholly and
solely to the part of the leaders.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, one ought not to lay all the blame for
what was done on that occasion on Philip, <span class="sidenote">The blame chiefly
belongs to
Demetrius of
Pharos.</span>
taking
his age into consideration; but chiefly on his
friends, who were in attendance upon him and
co-operating with him, among whom were
Aratus and Demetrius of Pharos. In regard to them it would
not be difficult to assert, even without being there, from
which of the two a counsel of this sort proceeded. For apart
from the general principles animating the whole course of his
life, in which nothing savouring of rashness and want of
judgment can be alleged of Aratus, while the exact contrary
may be said of Demetrius, we have an undisputed instance of
the principles actuating both the one and the other in
analogous circumstances, on which I shall speak in its proper
place.</p>

<p><a name="b5_13" id="b5_13"><b>13.</b></a> To return then to Philip. Taking with him as much
booty living and dead as he could, he started
from Thermus, <span class="sidenote">The return of
Philip from
Thermus.</span>
returning by the same road as
that by which he had come; putting the booty
and heavy-armed infantry in the van, and reserving the
Acarnanians and mercenaries to bring up the rear. He was
in great haste to get through the difficult passes, because he
expected that the Aetolians, relying on the security of their
strongholds, would harass his rear. And this in fact promptly
took place: for a body of Aetolians, that had collected to the
number of nearly three thousand for the defence of the
country, under the command of Alexander of Trichonium,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
hovered about, concealing themselves in certain secret hiding-places,
and not venturing to approach as long as Philip was
on the high ground; but as soon as he got his rear-guard in
motion they promptly threw themselves into Thermus and
began harassing the hindermost of the enemy&#8217;s column. The
rear being thus thrown into confusion, the attacks and charges
of the Aetolians became more and more furious, encouraged
by the nature of the ground. But Philip had foreseen this
danger, and had provided for it, by stationing his Illyrians
and his best peltasts under cover of a certain hill on the
descent. These men suddenly fell upon the advanced bodies
of the enemy as they were charging; whereupon the rest of
the Aetolian army fled in headlong haste over a wild and
trackless country, with a loss of a hundred and thirty killed, and
about the same number taken prisoners. This success relieved
his rear; which, after burning Pamphium, accomplished the
passage of the narrow gorge with rapidity and safety, and
effected a junction with the Macedonians near
Matape, <span class="sidenote">Matape.</span>
at which place Philip had pitched a
camp and was waiting for his rear-guard to come up. Next
day, after levelling Metape to the ground, <span class="sidenote">Acrae.</span>
he advanced to the
city called Acrae; next day to Conope, ravaging
the country as he passed, and there encamped
for the night. <span class="sidenote">Stratus.</span>On the next he marched along the Achelous as
far as Stratus; there he crossed the river, and,
having halted his men out of range, endeavoured
to tempt the garrison outside the walls; for he had been informed
that two thousand Aetolian infantry and about four hundred
horse, with five hundred Cretans, had collected into Stratus.
But when no one ventured out, he renewed his march, and
ordered his van to advance towards Limnaea and the ships.</p>

<p><a name="b5_14" id="b5_14"><b>14.</b></a> But no sooner had his rear passed the town than,
first, a small body of Aetolian cavalry sallied
out and began harassing the hindmost men; <span class="sidenote">Philip victorious
in a skirmish
with the garrison
of Stratus.</span>
and then, the whole of the Cretans and some
Aetolian troops having joined their cavalry, the
conflict became more severe, and the rear of Philip&#8217;s army
were forced to face about and engage the enemy. At first the
conflict was undecided; but on Philip&#8217;s mercenaries being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
supported by the arrival of the Illyrians, the Aetolian cavalry
and mercenaries gave way and fled in disorder. The royal
troops pursued most of them to the entrance of the gates, or up
to the walls, <span class="sidenote">Arrival at
Limnaea.</span>
and killed about a hundred of
them. After this skirmish the garrison remained
inactive, and the rear of the royal army reached
the camp and the ships in safety.</p>

<p>Philip pitched his camp early in the day, and proceeded to
make a thank offering to the gods for the successful issue of
his undertaking; and to invite the officers to a banquet, at
which it was his intention to entertain them all. His view
was that he had ventured upon a dangerous country, and such
as no one had ever ventured to enter with an army before;
while he had not only entered it with an army, but had returned
in safety, after accomplishing all that he had intended. But
while he was thus intent on entertaining his officers in great
elation of mind, Megaleas and Leontius were nursing feelings
of great annoyance at the success of the king. They had
arranged with Apelles to hamper all his plans, but had been
unable to do so; and now saw everything turning out exactly
contrary to their views.</p>

<p><a name="b5_15" id="b5_15"><b>15.</b></a> Still they came to the banquet, where they from the first
excited the suspicions of the king and the rest
of the company, <span class="sidenote">Megaleas and
Leontius betray
their chagrin
at the king&#8217;s
success.</span>
by showing less joy at the
events than the others present. But as the
drinking went on, and grew less and less
moderate, being forced to do just as the others
did, they soon showed themselves in their true colours. For
as soon as the company broke up, losing control over themselves
under the influence of wine, <span class="sidenote">They assault
Aratus.</span>
they roamed
about looking for Aratus; and having fallen in
with him on his way home, they first attacked
him with abusive language, and then threw stones at him;
and a number of people coming to the assistance of both
parties, there was a noise and disturbance in the camp. But
the king hearing the noise sent some officers to ascertain the
cause, and to put an end to the disturbance. On their coming
upon the scene, Aratus stated what had occurred, called those
present to witness the truth of his words, and retired to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
own tent; but Leontius by some unexplained means slipped
away in the crowd. When informed of what had taken place, <span class="sidenote">Megaleas and
Crinon held to
bail.</span>
the king sent for Megaleas and Crinon and
rebuked them sharply: and when they not only
expressed no submission, but actually retorted
with a declaration that they would never desist until they had
paid Aratus out, the king, enraged at their words, at once
required them to give security for the payment of a fine of
twenty talents, and ordered them to be placed under arrest.</p>

<p><a name="b5_16" id="b5_16"><b>16.</b></a> Next morning, too, he sent for Aratus and bade him
have no fears, for that he would see that the business was
properly settled. When Leontius learned what had happened
to Megaleas, he came to the king&#8217;s tent with some peltasts,
believing that, owing to his youth, he should overawe the king,
and quickly induce him to repent of his purpose. Coming
into the royal presence he demanded who had ventured to lay
hands on Megaleas, and lead him to confinement? But when
the king answered with firmness that he had given the order,
Leontius was dismayed; and, with an exclamation of indignant
sorrow, departed in high wrath. <span class="sidenote">Arrival at Leucas.
Megaleas fined
twenty talents.</span>
Immediately
after getting the fleet across the gulf, and
anchoring at Leucas, the king first gave orders
to the officers appointed to distribute the spoils to carry out
that business with all despatch; and then summoned his
friends to council, and tried the case of Megaleas. In his
speech as accuser Aratus went over the crimes of Leontius
and his party from beginning to end; detailed the massacre in
Argos perpetrated by them after the departure of Antigonus;
their arrangement made with Apelles; and finally their contrivance
to prevent success at Palus. Of all these accusations he
gave distinct proof, and brought forward witnesses: and
Megaleas and Crinon being entirely unable to refute any of
them, were unanimously condemned by the king&#8217;s friends.
Crinon remained under arrest, but Leontius went bail for the
payment of the Megaleas&#8217;s fine. Thus the intrigue of Apelles
and Leontius turned out quite contrary to their original hopes:
for they had expected, by terrifying Aratus and isolating
Philip, to do whatever seemed to suit their interests; whereas
the result had been exactly the reverse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b5_17" id="b5_17"><b>17.</b></a> About the same time Lycurgus returned from Messenia
without having accomplished anything of
importance. <span class="sidenote">Lycurgus of

Afterwards he started again and
seized Tegea. The inhabitants having retreated
into the citadel, he determined to besiege it; but finding himself
unable to make any impression upon it he returned once
more to Sparta.</p>

<p>The Eleans after overrunning Dymaea, gained an easy

They killed a considerable number of the Gallic mercenaries,
and among the natives whom they took prisoners were

<p>Dorimachus had made his expedition originally, as I have
already mentioned, under the conviction that <span class="sidenote">Dorimachus
recalled from
Thessaly by
Philip&#8217;s invasion
of Aetolia.</span>
he would be able to devastate Thessaly without
danger to himself, and would force Philip to
raise the siege of Palus. But when he found
Chrysogonus and Petraeus ready in Thessaly to
engage him, he did not venture to descend into the plain, but
kept close upon the skirts of the mountains; and when news
reached him of the Macedonian invasion of Aetolia, he
abandoned his attempt upon Thessaly, and hurried home to
resist the invaders, whom he found however already departed
from Aetolia: and so was too late for the campaign
at all points.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king set sail from Leucas; and after ravaging
the territory of Oeanthe as he coasted along, <span class="sidenote">Philip arrives at
Corinth.</span>
arrived with his whole fleet at Corinth, and
dropping anchor in the harbour of Lechaeum,
disembarked his troops, and sent his letter-bearers to the
allied cities in the Peloponnese, naming a day on which he
wished all to be at Tegea by bedtime.</p>

<p><a name="b5_18" id="b5_18"><b>18.</b></a> Then, without making any stay in Corinth, he gave the
<span class="sidenote">Tegea.</span>Macedonians marching orders; and came at the
end of a two days&#8217; march by way of Argos to
Tegea. There he took on the Achaean troops that had
assembled, and advanced by the mountain road, being very
desirous to effect an entrance into the territory of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Lacedaemonians before they became aware of it. Thus after
a circuitous route through an uninhabited <span class="sidenote">Amyclae and
Sparta.</span>
district he came out upon the hills facing the
town, and continued his advance right upon
Amyclae, keeping the Menela&iuml;um on his right. The Lacedaemonians
were dismayed and terrified at seeing from the town
the army passing along the hills, and wondered what was happening.
For they were still in a state of excitement at the news
of Philip which had arrived,&mdash;his destruction
of Thermus, <span class="sidenote">Dismay at
Sparta.</span>
and his whole campaign in Aetolia;
and there was even some talk among them of
sending Lycurgus to the assistance of the Aetolians. But no
one had so much as thought of danger coming so quickly to
their own gates from such a distance, especially as the youth
of the king still gave room for a certain feeling of contempt.
The event therefore being totally contrary to their expectations,
they were naturally in a state of great dismay. For the
courage and energy beyond his years, with which Philip acted,
reduced all his enemies to a state of the utmost difficulty and
terror. For setting out, as I have shown, from the centre of
Aetolia, and crossing the Ambracian gulf by night, he passed
over to Leucas; and after a two days&#8217; halt there, on the third
he renewed his voyage before daybreak, and after a two days&#8217;
sail, during which he ravaged the seaboard of the Aetolians, he
dropped anchor in Lechaeum; thence, after seven days&#8217;
continuous march, he arrived on the heights above Sparta in
the neighbourhood of the Menela&iuml;um,&mdash;a feat which most of
those even who saw it done could scarcely believe.</p>

<p><a name="b5_19" id="b5_19"><b>19.</b></a> While the Lacedaemonians were thus thoroughly
terrified at the unexpected danger, and at a loss what to do
to meet it, Philip encamped on the first day at Amyclae:
a place in Laconia about twenty stades from Lacedaemon,
exceedingly rich in forest and corn, and containing a temple
of Apollo, which is about the most splendid of all the
temples in Laconia, situated in that quarter of the city which
slopes down towards the sea. Next day the king descended
to a place called the Camp of Pyrrhus,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> wasting the country as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
he went. After devastating the neighbouring districts for the
two following days, he encamped near Carnium; <span class="sidenote">Carnium.</span>
thence he started for Asine, and after some
fruitless assaults upon it, he started again, and thenceforth
devoted himself to plundering all the country bordering on
the Cretan Sea as far as Taenarum. <span class="sidenote">Gythium.</span>Then, once more
changing the direction of his march, he advanced
to Gythium, the naval arsenal of Sparta, which
possesses a safe harbour, and is about thirty stades from the
city. <span class="sidenote">Helos.</span>
Then leaving this on the right, he pitched
his camp in the territory of Helos, which of
all the districts of Laconia is the most extensive and most
beautiful. Thence he sent out foraging parties and wasted
the country with fire and sword, and destroyed the crops in it:
pushing his devastation as far as Acriae and Leucae, and
even to the district of Boeae.</p>

<p><a name="b5_20" id="b5_20"><b>20.</b></a> On the receipt of the despatch from Philip commanding
the levy, the Messenians were no less forward <span class="sidenote">Abortive attempt
of the Messenians
to join Philip.</span>
than the other allies to undertake it. They
showed indeed great zeal in making the expedition,
sending out the flower of their troops, two thousand
infantry and two hundred cavalry. Owing, however, to their
distance from the seat of war, they arrived at Tegea after Philip
had left, and at first were at a loss what to do; but being
very anxious not to appear lukewarm in the campaign, because
of the suspicions which had attached to them before, they
pressed forward through Argolis into Laconia, with a view of
effecting a junction with Philip; and having reached a fort
called Glympes, which is situated on the frontiers of Argolis and
Laconia, they encamped there in an unskilful and careless
manner: for they neither entrenched themselves with ditch
nor rampart, nor selected an advantageous spot; but trusting
to the friendly disposition of the natives, bivouacked there
unsuspiciously outside the walls of the fortress. But on
news being brought to Lycurgus of the arrival of the
Messenians, he took his mercenaries and some Lacedaemonians
with him, and reaching the place before daybreak,
boldly attacked the camp. Ill advised as the proceedings
of the Messenians had been, and especially in advancing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
from Tegea with inadequate numbers and without the direction
of experts, in the actual hour of danger, when the enemy
was upon them, they did all that circumstances admitted of
to secure their safety. For as soon as they saw the enemy
appearing they abandoned everything and took refuge within
the fort. Accordingly, though Lycurgus captured most of the
horses and the baggage, he did not take a single prisoner, and
only succeeded in killing eight of the cavalry. After this
reverse, the Messenians returned home through Argolis: but
elated with success Lycurgus went to Sparta, <span class="sidenote">Lycurgus resolves
to intercept Philip
on his return at
the pass opposite
Sparta.</span>
and set about preparations for war; and took
secret counsel with his friends to prevent
Philip from getting safe out of the country without
an engagement. Meanwhile the king had
started from the district of Helos, and was on his return
march, wasting the country as he came; and on the fourth day,
about noon, arrived once more with his whole army at
Amyclae.</p>

<p><a name="b5_21" id="b5_21"><b>21.</b></a> Leaving directions with his officers and friends as to
the coming engagement, Lycurgus himself left Sparta and
occupied the ground near the Menela&iuml;um, with as many as two
thousand men. He agreed with the officers in the town that
they should watch carefully, in order that, whenever he raised
the signal, they might lead out their troops from the town at
several points at once, and draw them up facing the Eurotas, at
the spot where it is nearest the town. Such were the measures
and designs of Lycurgus and the Lacedaemonians.</p>

<p>But lest ignorance of the locality should render my story
unintelligible and vague, I must describe its
natural features and general position: <span class="sidenote">Value of local
knowledge.</span>
following
my practice throughout this work of drawing
out the analogies and likenesses between places which are
unknown and those already known and described. For seeing
that in war, whether by sea or land, it is the difference of
position which generally is the cause of failure; and since I
wish all to know, not so much what happened, as how it
happened, I must not pass over local description in detailing
events of any sort, least of all in such as relate to war: and I
must not shrink from using as landmarks, at one time harbours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
and seas and islands, at another temples, mountains, or local
names; or, finally, variations in the aspect of the heaven, these
being of the most universal application throughout the world.
For it is thus, and thus only, that it is possible, as I have said,
to bring my readers to a conception of an unknown scene.</p>

<p><a name="b5_22" id="b5_22"><b>22.</b></a> These then are the features of the country in question.
Sparta, as a whole, is in the shape of a circle; <span class="sidenote">The position of
Sparta and the
neighbouring
heights.</span>
and is situated on level ground, broken at
certain points by irregularities and hills. The
river Eurotas flows past it on the east, and for
the greater part of the year is too large to be forded; and the
hills on which the Menela&iuml;um stands are on the other side of
the river, to the south-east of the town, rugged and difficult of
access and exceedingly lofty; they exactly command the space
between the town and the Eurotas, which flows at the very
foot of the hill, the whole valley being at this point no more
than a stade and a half wide. <span class="sidenote">The dispositions
of Lycurgus.</span>
Through this Philip was
obliged to pass on his return march, with the
city, and the Lacedaemonians ready and
drawn up for battle, on his left hand, and on
his right the river, and the division of Lycurgus posted upon
the hills. In addition to these arrangements the Lacedaemonians
had had recourse to the following device: They
had dammed up the river above the town, and turned the
stream upon the space between the town and the hills; with the
result that the ground became so wet that men could not
keep their feet, to say nothing of horses. The only course,
therefore, left to the king was to lead his men close under the
skirts of the hills, thus presenting to the attack of the enemy
a long line of march, in which it was difficult for one part to
relieve another.</p>

<p>Philip perceived these difficulties, and after consultation
with his friends decided that the matter of most <span class="sidenote">Philip succeeds
in baffling
Lycurgus.</span>
urgent necessity was to dislodge the division of
Lycurgus, first of all, from the position near the
Menela&iuml;um. He took therefore his mercenaries, peltasts,
and Illyrians, and advanced across the river in the direction of
the hills. Perceiving Philip&#8217;s design, Lycurgus began getting
his men ready, and exhorted them to face the battle, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
at the same time displayed the signal to the forces in the
town: whereupon those whose duty it was immediately led
out the troops from the town, as had been arranged, and
drew them up outside the wall, with the cavalry on their right
wing.</p>

<p><a name="b5_23" id="b5_23"><b>23.</b></a> When he had got within distance of Lycurgus, Philip
at first ordered the mercenaries to charge alone: and, accordingly,
their superiority in arms and position contributed not a
little to give the Lacedaemonians the upper hand at the
beginning of the engagement. But when Philip supported his
men by sending his reserve of peltasts on to the field, and
caused the Illyrians to charge the enemy on the flanks, the
king&#8217;s mercenaries were encouraged by the appearance of
these reserves to renew the battle with much more vigour than
ever; while Lycurgus&#8217;s men, terrified at the approach of the
heavy-armed soldiers, gave way and fled, leaving a hundred killed
and rather more prisoners, while the rest escaped into the
town. Lycurgus himself, with a few followers going by a
deserted and pathless route, made his way into the town
under cover of night. Philip secured the hills by means of
the Illyrians; and, accompanied by his light-armed troops and
peltasts, rejoined his main forces. Just at the same time
Aratus, leading the phalanx from Amyclae, had come close
to the town. So the king, after recrossing the Eurotas, halted
with his light-armed peltasts and cavalry until the heavy-armed
got safely through the narrow part of the road at the foot of
the hills. Then the troops in the city ventured to attack the
covering force of cavalry. There was a serious engagement,
in which the peltasts fought with conspicuous valour; and the
success of Philip being now beyond dispute, he chased the
Lacedaemonians to their very gates, and then, having got his
army safely across the Eurotas he brought up the rear of his
phalanx.</p>

<p><a name="b5_24" id="b5_24"><b>24.</b></a> But it was now getting late: and being obliged to
encamp, he availed himself for that purpose of
a place at the very mouth of the pass, <span class="sidenote">Philip&#8217;s strong
position.</span>
his
officers having chanced already to have
selected that very place; than which it would be impossible
to find one more advantageous for making an invasion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
Laconia by way of Sparta itself. For it is at the very
commencement of this pass, just where a man coming from
Tegea, or, indeed, from any point in the interior, approaches
Sparta; being about two stades from the town and right upon
the river. The side of it which looks towards the town and
river is entirely covered by a steep, lofty, and entirely
inaccessible rock; while the top of this rock is a table-land of
good soil and well supplied with water, and very conveniently
situated for the exit and entrance of troops. A general,
therefore, who was encamped there, and who had command
of the height overhanging it, would evidently be in a place of
safety as regards the neighbouring town, and in a most
advantageous situation as commanding the entrance and exit
of the narrow pass. Having accordingly encamped himself
on this spot in safety, next day Philip sent forward his baggage;
but drew out his army on the table-land in full view of the
citizens, and remained thus for a short time. <span class="sidenote">Sellasia,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;222.</span>
Then he wheeled
to the left and marched in the direction of
Tegea; and when he reached the site of the
battle of Antigonus and Cleomenes, he encamped
there. Next day, having made an inspection of the
ground and sacrificed to the gods on both the eminences,
Olympus and Evas, he advanced with his rear-guard strengthened.
On arriving at Tegea he caused all the <span class="sidenote">Philip proceeds to
Tegea, where he
is visited by
ambassadors from
Rhodes and Chios
seeking to end
the Aetolian war.</span>
booty to be sold; and then, marching through
Argos, arrived with his whole force at Corinth.
There ambassadors appeared from Rhodes
and Chios to negotiate a suspension of
hostilities; to whom the king gave audience,
and feigning that he was, and always had
been, quite ready to come to terms with the Aetolians, sent
them away to negotiate with the latter also; while he himself
went down to Lechaeum, and made preparations for an
embarkation, as he had an important undertaking to complete
in Phocis.</p>

<p><a name="b5_25" id="b5_25"><b>25.</b></a> Leontius, Megaleas, and Ptolemy, being still persuaded
that they could frighten Philip, and thus neutralise
their former failures, took this opportunity of tampering
with the peltasts, and what the Macedonians call the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
<i>Agema</i>,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> by suggesting to them that they were risking their all,
and getting none of their just rights, nor receiving
the booty which, <span class="sidenote">Treason of
Megaleas and
Ptolemy.</span>according to custom, properly
fell to their share. By these words they incited
the young men to collect together, and attempt to plunder the
tents of the most prominent of the king&#8217;s friends, and to pull
down the doors, and break through the roof of the royal
headquarters.</p>

<p>The whole city being thereby in a state of confusion
and uproar, the king heard of it and immediately came hastily
running to the town from Lechaeum; and having summoned
the Macedonians to the theatre he addressed them in terms of
mingled exhortation and rebuke for what had happened. A
scene of great uproar and confusion followed: and while some
advised him to arrest and call to account the guilty, others to
come to terms and declare an indemnity, for the moment the
king dissembled his feelings, and pretended to be satisfied; and
so with some words of exhortation addressed to all, retired:
and though he knew quite well who were the ringleaders
in the disturbance, he made a politic pretence of not doing so.</p>

<p><a name="b5_26" id="b5_26"><b>26.</b></a> After this outbreak the king&#8217;s schemes in Phocis met
with certain impediments which prevented their
present execution. <span class="sidenote">Apelles sent for
by Leontius.</span>
Meanwhile Leontius, despairing
of success by his own efforts, had
recourse to Apelles, urging him by frequent messages to come
from Chalcis, and setting forth his own difficulties and the
awkwardness of his position owing to his quarrel with the
king. Now Apelles had been acting in Chalcis with an
unwarrantable assumption of authority. He gave out that
the king was still a mere boy, and for the most part under his
control, and without independent power over anything; the
management of affairs and the supreme authority in the
kingdom he asserted to belong to himself. Accordingly, the
magistrates and commissioners of Macedonia and Thessaly
reported to him; and the cities in Greece in their decrees and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
votes of honours and rewards made brief reference to the
king, while Apelles was all in all to them. Philip had been
kept informed of this, and had for some time past been feeling
annoyed and offended at it,&mdash;Aratus being at his side, and
using skilful means to further his own views; still he kept his
own counsel, and did not let any one see what he intended to
do, or what he had in his mind. In ignorance, therefore, of his
own position, and persuaded that, if he could only come into
Philip&#8217;s presence, he would manage everything as he chose,
Apelles set out from Chalcis to the assistance
of Leontius. <span class="sidenote">Apelles rebuffed
by the king.</span>
On his arrival at Corinth, Leontius,
Ptolemy and Megaleas, being commanders of
the peltasts and the other chief divisions of the army, took great
pains to incite the young men to go to meet him. He entered
the town, therefore, with great pomp, owing to the number of
officers and soldiers who went to meet him, and proceeded
straight to the royal quarters. But when he would have
entered, according to his former custom, one of the ushers
prevented him, saying that the king was engaged. Troubled
at this unusual repulse, and hesitating for a long while what to
do, Apelles at last turned round and retired. Thereupon all
those who were escorting him began at once openly to fall off
from him and disperse, so that at last he entered his own
lodging, with his children, absolutely alone. So true it is all the
world over that a moment exalts and abases
us; <span class="sidenote">Courtiers.</span>
but most especially is this true of courtiers.
They indeed are exactly like counters on a board, which, according
to the pleasure of the calculator, are one moment worth a
farthing, the next a talent. Even so courtiers at the king&#8217;s
nod are one moment at the summit of prosperity, at another
the objects of pity. When Megaleas saw that the help
he had looked for from Apelles was failing him, he was
exceedingly frightened, and made preparations for flight.
Apelles meanwhile was admitted to the king&#8217;s banquets and
honours of that sort, but had no share in his council or daily
social employments; and when, some days afterwards, the
king resumed his voyage from Lechaeum, to complete his
designs in Phocis, he took Apelles with him.</p>

was retiring from Elatea; and while this was going on,
Megaleas removed to Athens, leaving Leontius behind him
as his security for his twenty talents fine. <span class="sidenote">Flight of
Megaleas.</span>
The
Athenian Strategi however refused to admit him,
and he therefore resumed his journey and went
to Thebes. Meanwhile the king put to sea from the coast
of Cirrha and sailed with his guards<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> to the harbour of
Sicyon, whence he went up to the city and, excusing himself to
the magistrates, took up his quarters with Aratus, and spent
the whole of his time with him, ordering Apelles to sail back
to Corinth. But upon news being brought him
of the proceedings of Megaleas, <span class="sidenote">Leontius put to
death.</span>
he despatched
the peltasts, whose regular commander was
Leontius, in the charge of Taurion to Triphylia, on the pretext
of some service of pressing need; and, when they had departed,
he gave orders to arrest Leontius to answer his bail. When
the peltasts heard what had happened from a messenger sent
to them by Leontius, they despatched ambassadors to the king,
begging him that, &#8220;if he had arrested Leontius on any other
score, not to have him tried on the charges alleged against him
without their presence: for otherwise they should consider
themselves treated with signal contempt, and to be one and all
involved in the condemnation.&#8221; Such was the freedom of speech
towards their king which the Macedonians always enjoyed.
They added, that &#8220;if the arrest was on account of his bail for
Megaleas, they would themselves pay the money by a common
subscription.&#8221; The king however was so enraged, that he put
Leontius to death sooner than he had intended, owing to the
zeal displayed by the peltasts.</p>

<p><a name="b5_28" id="b5_28"><b>28.</b></a> Presently the ambassadors of Rhodes and Chios
returned from Aetolia. They had agreed to a
truce of thirty days, <span class="sidenote">A thirty days&#8217;

and asserted that the

also arranged for a stated day on which they
claimed that Philip should meet them at Rhium;
undertaking that the Aetolians would be ready
to do anything on condition of making peace. Philip accepted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
the truce and wrote letters to the allies, bidding
them send assessors and commissioners to discuss the terms
with the Aetolians; <span class="sidenote">Treason of
Megaleas detected.
His

while he himself sailed
from Lechaeum and arrived on the second day
at Patrae. Just then certain letters were sent to
him from Phocis, which Megaleas had written
to the Aetolians, exhorting them not to be frightened, but to
persist in the war, because Philip was in extremities through a
lack of provisions. Besides this the letters contained some
offensive and bitter abuse of the king. As soon as he had
read these, the king feeling no doubt that Apelles was the
ringleader of the mischief, placed him under a guard and despatched
him in all haste to Corinth, with his son and favourite
boy; while he sent Alexander to Thebes to arrest Megaleas,
with orders to bring him before the magistrates to answer to
his bail. When Alexander had fulfilled his commission,
Megaleas, not daring to await the issue, committed
suicide: <span class="sidenote">Death of Appelles.</span>
and about the same time
Apelles, his son and favourite boy, ended their lives also. Such
was the end of these men, thoroughly deserved in every way,
and especially for their outrageous conduct to Aratus.</p>

<p><a name="b5_29" id="b5_29"><b>29.</b></a> Now the Aetolians were at first very anxious for the
ratification of a peace, because they found the
war burdensome, <span class="sidenote">Failure of the

and because things had not
gone as they expected. For, looking to his
tender years and lack of experience, they had expected to have
a mere child to deal with in Philip; but had found him a full-grown
man both in his designs and his manner of executing
them: while they had themselves made a display of imbecility
and childishness alike in the general conduct, and the particular
actions, of the campaign. But as soon as they heard of the
outbreak of the disturbance among the peltasts, and of the
deaths of Apelles and Leontius, hoping that there was a
serious and formidable disaffection at the court, they procrastinated
until they had outstayed the day appointed for the
meeting at Rhium. But Philip was delighted to seize the
pretext: for he felt confident of success in the war, and had
already resolved to avoid coming to terms. He therefore
at once exhorted such of the allies as had come to meet him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
to make preparations, not for the peace, but for war; and
putting to sea again sailed back to Corinth. He then dismissed
his Macedonian soldiers to go home through Thessaly for
the winter: while he himself putting to sea from Cenchreae,
and coasting along Attica, sailed through the Euripus to
Demetrias, and there before a jury of Macedonians had
Ptolemy tried and put to death, who was the last survivor of
the conspiracy of Leontius.</p>

<p>It was in this season that Hannibal, having succeeded in
entering Italy, was lying encamped in presence
of the Roman army in the valley of the Padus. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218.
Review of the
events of the year
in Italy, Asia,
Sparta.</span>
Antiochus, after subduing the greater part of
Coele-Syria, had once more dismissed his army
into winter quarters. The Spartan king
Lycurgus fled to Aetolia in fear of the Ephors: for acting on a
false charge that he was meditating a <i>coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i>, they had
collected the young men and come to his house at night. But
getting previous intimation of what was impending, he had
quitted the town accompanied by the members of his household.</p>

<p><a name="b5_30" id="b5_30"><b>30.</b></a> When the next winter came, Philip having departed
to Macedonia, and the Achaean Strategus <span class="sidenote">Winter of
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218-217.</span>
Eperatus having incurred the contempt of the
Achaean soldiers and the complete disregard
of the mercenaries, no one would obey his orders, and
no preparation was made for the defence of the country.
This was observed by Pyrrhias, who had been <span class="sidenote">Disorder in
Achaia owing to
the incompetence
of the Strategus
Eperatus.</span>
sent by the Aetolians to command the Eleans.
He had under him a force of thirteen hundred
Aetolians, and the mercenaries hired by the
Eleans, as well as a thousand Elean infantry and
two hundred Elean cavalry, amounting in all to three thousand:
and he now began committing frequent raids, not only upon
the territories of Dyme and Pharae, but upon that of Patrae
also. Finally he pitched his camp on what is called the Panachaean
Mountain, which commands the town of Patrae, and
began wasting the whole district towards Rhium and Aegium.
The result was that the cities, being exposed to much suffering,
and unable to obtain any assistance, began to make difficulties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
about paying their contribution to the league; and the soldiers
finding their pay always in arrear and never paid at the right
time acted in the same way about going to the relief of the
towns. Both parties thus mutually retaliating on each other,
affairs went from bad to worse, and at last the foreign contingent
broke up altogether. And all this was the result of the
incompetence of the chief magistrate. <span class="sidenote">May, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.

The
time for the next election finding Achaean
affairs in this state, Eperatus laid down his office,
and just at the beginning of summer Aratus the elder was
elected Strategus.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>Such was the position of affairs in Europe. We have now
arrived at a proper juncture, both of events
and of time, <span class="sidenote">140th Olympiad,
Asia.</span>
to transfer our narrative to the
history of Asia. I will therefore resume my
story of the transactions which occurred there during the same
Olympiad.</p>

<p><a name="b5_31" id="b5_31"><b>31.</b></a> I will first endeavour, in accordance with my original
plan, to give an account of the war between Antiochus and
Ptolemy for the possession of Coele-Syria. Though I am
fully aware that at the period, at which I have stopped in my
Greek history, this war was all but decided and concluded, I
have yet deliberately chosen this particular break and division
in my narrative; believing that I shall effectually provide
against the possibility of mistakes on the part of my readers in
regard to dates, if I indicate in the course of my narrative the
years in this Olympiad in which the events in the several parts
of the world, as well as in Greece, began and ended. For I
think nothing more essential to the clearness of my history of
this Olympiad than to avoid confusing the several narratives.
Our object should be to distinguish and keep them separate as
much as possible, until we come to the next Olympiad, and
begin setting down the contemporary events in the several
countries under each year. For since I have undertaken to
write, not a particular, but a universal history, and have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>ventured upon a plan on a greater scale, as I have already
shown, than any of my predecessors, it will be necessary also
for me to take greater care than they, as to my method of
treatment and arrangement; so as to secure clearness, both in
the details, and in the general view adopted in my history. I
will accordingly go back a short way in the history of
the kingdoms of Antiochus and Ptolemy, and try to fix upon
a starting-point for my narrative which shall be accepted
and recognised by all: for this is a matter of the first
importance.</p>

<p><a name="b5_32" id="b5_32"><b>32.</b></a> For the old saying, &#8220;Well begun is half done,&#8221; was
meant by its inventors to urge the importance of taking the
greater pains to make a good beginning than anything else.
And though some may consider this an exaggeration, in my
opinion it comes short of the truth; for one might say with
confidence, not that &#8220;the beginning was half the business,&#8221; but
rather that it was near being the whole. For how can one
make a good beginning without having first grasped in thought
the complete plan, or without knowing where, with what
object, and with what purpose he is undertaking the business?
Or how can a man sum up a series of events satisfactorily
without a reference to their origin, and without showing his
point of departure, or why and how he has arrived at the
particular crisis at which he finds himself? Therefore both
historian and reader alike should be exceedingly careful to
mark the beginnings of events, with a conviction that their
influence does not stop half-way, but is paramount to the end.
And this is what I shall endeavour to do.</p>

<p><a name="b5_33" id="b5_33"><b>33.</b></a> I am aware, however, that a similar profession has
been made by many other historians of an intention to write a
universal history, and of undertaking a work on a larger scale
than their predecessors. About these writers, putting out of
the question Ephorus, the first and only man who has really attempted
a universal history, I will not mention any name or say
more about them than this,&mdash;that several of my contemporaries,
while professing to write a universal history have imagined that
they could tell the story of the war of Rome and Carthage in
three or four pages. Yet every one knows that events more
numerous or important were never accomplished in Iberia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Libya, Sicily, and Italy than in that war; and that the
Hannibalian war was the most famous and lasting of any that
has taken place except the Sicilian. So momentous was it,
that all the rest of the world were compelled to watch it in
terrified expectation of what would follow from its final
catastrophe. Yet some of these writers, without even giving
as many details of it as those who, after the manner of the
vulgar, inscribe rude records of events on house walls, pretend
to have embraced the whole of Greek and foreign history.
The truth of the matter is, that it is a very easy matter to
profess to undertake works of the greatest importance; but by
no means so simple a matter in practice to attain to any
excellence. The former is open to every one with the
requisite audacity: the latter is rare, and is given to few. So
much for those who use pompous language about themselves
and their historical works. I will now return to my narrative.</p>

<p><a name="b5_34" id="b5_34"><b>34.</b></a> Immediately after his father&#8217;s death, Ptolemy Philopator
put his brother Magas and his partisans to
death, <span class="sidenote">Death of Ptolemy
Euergetes,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;222.</span>
and took possession of the throne of
Egypt. He thought that he had now freed himself
by this act from domestic danger; and that by the deaths
of Antigonus and Seleucus, and their being respectively
succeeded by mere children like Antiochus and Philip, fortune
had released him from danger abroad. He therefore felt
secure of his position and began conducting his reign as
though it were a perpetual festival. He would attend to no
business, and would hardly grant an interview to the officials
about the court, or at the head of the administrative departments
in Egypt. Even his agents abroad found him entirely
careless and indifferent; though his predecessors, far from
taking less interest in foreign affairs, had generally given them
precedence over those of Egypt itself. For being masters of
Coele-Syria and Cyprus, they maintained a threatening
attitude towards the kings of Syria, both by land and sea; and
were also in a commanding position in regard to the princes of
Asia, as well as the islands, through their possession of the most
splendid cities, strongholds, and harbours all along the sea-coast
from Pamphylia to the Hellespont and the district round
Lysimachia. Moreover they were favourably placed for an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
attack upon Thrace and Macedonia from their possession of
Aenus, Maroneia, and more distant cities still. And having
thus stretched forth their hands to remote regions, and long
ago strengthened their position by a ring of princedoms, these
kings had never been anxious about their rule in Egypt; and
had naturally, therefore, given great attention to foreign politics.
But when Philopator, absorbed in unworthy intrigues,
and senseless and continuous drunkenness, treated these several
branches of government with equal indifference, it was naturally
not long before more than one was found to lay plots against
his life as well as his power: of whom the first was Cleomenes,
the Spartan.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<p><a name="b5_35" id="b5_35"><b>35.</b></a> As long as Euergetes was alive, with whom he had
agreed to make an alliance and confederacy,
Cleomenes took no steps. <span class="sidenote">Cleomenes
endeavours to get
assistance from
the Egyptian
court.</span>But upon that
monarch&#8217;s death, seeing that the time was
slipping away, and that the peculiar position of
affairs in Greece seemed almost to cry aloud for
Cleomenes,&mdash;for Antigonus was dead, the Achaeans involved
in war, and the Lacedaemonians were at one with the
Aetolians in hostility to the Achaeans and Macedonians, which
was the policy originally adopted by Cleomenes,&mdash;then, indeed,
he was actually compelled to use some expedition, and to
bestir himself to secure his departure from Alexandria.
First therefore, in interviews with the king, he urged him to
send him out with the needful amount of supplies and troops;
but not being listened to in this request, he next begged him
earnestly to let him go alone with his own servants; for he
affirmed that the state of affairs was such as to show him sufficient
opportunities for recovering his ancestral throne. The king,
however, for the reasons I have mentioned, taking absolutely
no interest in such matters, nor exercising any foresight
whatever, continued with extraordinary folly and blindness to
neglect the petitions of Cleomenes. But the party of Sosibius,
the leading statesman at the time, took counsel together, and
agreed on the following course of action in regard to him.
They decided not to send him out with a fleet and supplies;
for, owing to the death of Antigonus, they took little account
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>of foreign affairs, and thought money spent on such things
would be thrown away. Besides, they were afraid that since
Antigonus was dead, and no one was left who could balance him,
Cleomenes might, if he got Greece into his power quickly and
without trouble, prove a serious and formidable rival to themselves;
especially as he had had a clear view of Egyptian
affairs, had learnt to despise the king; and had discovered that
the kingdom had many parts loosely attached, and widely
removed from the centre, and presenting many facilities for
revolutionary movements: for not a few of their ships were at
Samos, and a considerable force of soldiers at Ephesus. These
considerations induced them to reject the idea of sending
Cleomenes out with supplies; for they thought it by no means
conducive to their interests to carelessly let a man go, who was
certain to be their opponent and enemy. The other proposal
was to keep him there against his will; but this they all
rejected at once without discussion, on the principle that the
lion and the flock could not safely share the same stall.
Sosibius himself took the lead in regarding this idea with
aversion, and his reason was this.</p>

<p><a name="b5_36" id="b5_36"><b>36.</b></a> While engaged in effecting the destruction of Magas
and Berenice, his anxiety at the possible failure
of his attempt, <span class="sidenote">The reason of
the opposition of
Sosibius.</span>
especially through the courageous
character of Berenice, had forced him to flatter
the courtiers, and give them all hopes of advantage in case
his intrigue succeeded. It was at this juncture that, observing
Cleomenes to stand in need of the king&#8217;s help, and to be
possessed of a clear understanding and a genuine grasp of the
situation, he admitted him to a knowledge of his design, holding
out to him hopes of great advantage. And when
Cleomenes saw that Sosibius was in a state of great anxiety,
and above all afraid of the foreign soldiers and mercenaries,
he bade him not be alarmed; and undertook that the
foreign soldiers should do him no harm, but should
rather be of assistance to him. And on Sosibius expressing
surprise rather than conviction at this promise, he
said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that there are three thousand
foreign soldiers here from the Peloponnese, and a thousand
from Crete? I have only to nod to these men, and every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
man of them will at once do what I want. With these
all ready to hand, whom do you fear? Surely not mere
Syrians and Carians.&#8221; Sosibius was much pleased at the
remark at the time, and doubly encouraged in his intrigue
against Berenice; but ever afterwards, when observing the
indifference of the king, he repeated it to himself, and put
before his eyes the boldness of Cleomenes, and the goodwill
of the foreign contingent towards him.</p>

<p><a name="b5_37" id="b5_37"><b>37.</b></a> These feelings now moved him to advise the king and
his friends above all things to arrest and incarcerate
Cleomenes: <span class="sidenote">The intrigue of
Sosibius against
Cleomenes.</span>and to carry out this policy
he availed himself of the following circumstance,
which happened conveniently for him. There was a certain
Messenian called Nicagoras, an ancestral guest-friend of the
Lacedaemonian king Archidamus. They had not previously
had much intercourse; but when Archidamus fled from Sparta,
for fear of Cleomenes, and came to Messenia, not only did
Nicagoras show great kindness in receiving him under his
roof and furnishing him with other necessaries, but from the
close association that followed a very warm friendship and
intimacy sprang up between them: and accordingly when
Cleomenes subsequently gave Archidamus some expectation
of being restored to his city, and composing their quarrels,
Nicagoras devoted himself to conducting the negotiation and
settling the terms of their compact. These being ratified,
Archidamus returned to Sparta relying on the treaty made by
the agency of Nicagoras. But as soon as he met him,
Cleomenes assassinated Archidamus,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> sparing however Nicagoras
and his companions. To the outside world Nicagoras
pretended to be under an obligation to Cleomenes for saving
his life; but in heart he was exceedingly incensed at what had
happened, because he had the discredit of having been the
cause of the king&#8217;s death. Now it happened that this same
Nicagoras had, a short time before the events of which we are
speaking, come to Alexandria with a cargo of horses. Just as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>he was disembarking he came upon Cleomenes, Panterus, and
Hippitas walking together along the quay. When Cleomenes
saw him, he came up and welcomed him warmly, and asked
him on what business he was come. Upon his replying that
he had brought a cargo of horses, &#8220;You had better,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;have brought a cargo of catamites and sakbut girls; for
that is what the present king is fond of.&#8221; Nicagoras laughed,
and said nothing at the time: but some days afterwards, when
he had, in the course of his horse-sales, become more intimate
with Sosibius, he did Cleomenes the ill turn of repeating his
recent sarcasm; and seeing that Sosibius heard it with
satisfaction, he related to him the whole story of his grievance
against Cleomenes.</p>

<p><a name="b5_38" id="b5_38"><b>38.</b></a> Finding then that he was hostile in feeling to
Cleomenes, Sosibius persuaded Nicagoras, partly by presents
given on the spot and partly by promises for the future, to
write a letter accusing Cleomenes, and leave it sealed; that as
soon as he had sailed, as he would do in a few days, his servant
might bring it to him as though sent by Nicagoras. Nicagoras
performed his part in the plot; and after he had sailed, the
letter was brought by the servant to Sosibius, who at once
took the servant and the letter to the king. The servant
stated that Nicagoras had left the letter with orders to deliver
it to Sosibius; and the letter declared that it was the intention
of Cleomenes, if he failed to secure his despatch from the
country with suitable escort and provisions, to stir up a
rebellion against the king. Sosibius at once seized the
opportunity of urging on the king and his friends to take
prompt precautions against Cleomenes and to put him
in ward. <span class="sidenote">Cleomenes put
under arrest.</span>
This was at once done, and a very
large house was assigned to him in which he
lived under guard, differing from other prisoners
only in the superior size of his prison. Finding himself in
this distressing plight, and with fear of worse for the future,
Cleomenes determined to make the most desperate attempts
for freedom: not so much because he felt confident of success,&mdash;for
he had none of the elements of success in such an enterprise
on his side,&mdash;but rather because he was eager to die
nobly, and endure nothing unworthy of the gallantry which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
had previously displayed. He must, I think, as is usually
the case with men of high courage, have recalled and reflected
upon as his model those words of the hero:<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Yea, let me die,&mdash;but not a coward&#8217;s death,</div>
<div class="line">Nor all inglorious: let me do one deed,</div>
<div class="line">That children yet unborn may hear and mark!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a name="b5_39" id="b5_39"><b>39.</b></a> He therefore waited for the time at which the king left
Alexandria for Canopus, and then spread a
report among his guards that he was going to
be released by the king; <span class="sidenote">Bold attempt of
Cleomenes to

failure and death,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
and on this pretext
entertained his own attendants at a banquet,
and sent out some flesh of the sacrificial victims,
some garlands, and some wine to his guards.
The latter indulged in these good things unsuspiciously, and
became completely drunk; whereupon Cleomenes walked out
about noon, accompanied by his friends and servants armed
with daggers, without being noticed by his guard. As the
party advanced they met Ptolemy in the street, who had been
left by the king in charge of the city; and overawing his
attendants by the audacity of his proceeding, dragged Ptolemy
himself from his chariot and put him in a place of security,
while they loudly called upon the crowds of citizens to assert
their freedom. But every one was unprepared for the movement,
and therefore no one obeyed their summons or joined
them; and they accordingly turned their steps to the citadel,
with the intention of bursting open the doors and obtaining
the help of the prisoners confined there. But the commanders
of the citadel were on the alert, and learning what was going
to take place had secured the entrance gate: having therefore
failed in this design they killed themselves like brave men and
Spartans.</p>

<p>Such was the end of Cleomenes: a man of brilliant social
qualities, with a natural aptitude for affairs, and, in a word,
endued with all the qualifications of a general and a king.</p>

<p><a name="b5_40" id="b5_40"><b>40.</b></a> Shortly after the catastrophe of Cleomenes, the governor
of Coele-Syria, who was an Aetolian by birth, resolved to hold
treasonable parley with Antiochus and put the cities of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
province into his hands. He was induced to take this step
partly by the contempt with which Ptolemy&#8217;s <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220-219.
The origin of the
war in Coele-Syria.</span>
shameful debauchery and general conduct had
inspired him; and partly by distrust of the
king&#8217;s ministers, which he had learned to entertain
in the course of the recent attempt of Antiochus upon
Coele-Syria: for in that campaign he had rendered signal
service to Ptolemy, and yet, far from receiving any thanks for
it, he had been summoned to Alexandria and barely escaped
losing his life. The advances which he now made to Antiochus
were gladly received, and the affair was soon in the course of
being rapidly completed.</p>

<p>But I must make my readers acquainted with the position
of the royal family of Syria as I have already done with that
of Egypt; and in order to do so, I will go back to the
succession of Antiochus to the throne, and give a summary of
events from that point to the beginning of the war of which I
am to speak.</p>

<p>Antiochus was the younger son of Seleucus Callinicus; and
on the death of his father, and the succession <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;226.</span>
in right of seniority of his brother Seleucus to
the throne, he at first removed to upper Asia and lived there.
But Seleucus having been treacherously assassinated after crossing
Mount Taurus with his army, as I have already related,
he succeeded to the throne himself; <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;223.
See <b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_48">48</a>.</span>
and made
Achaeus governor of Asia on this side Taurus,
Molon and his brother Alexander guardians of
his dominions in upper Asia,&mdash;Molon acting as Satrap of Media,
his brother of Persia.</p>

<p><a name="b5_41" id="b5_41"><b>41.</b></a> These two brothers despising the king for his youth,
and hoping that Achaeus would join in their
treason, <span class="sidenote">Revolt of Molon.</span>
but most of all because they dreaded
the cruel character and malign influence of Hermeias, who
was at that time the chief minister of the entire kingdom,
formed the design of revolting themselves and causing the
upper Satrapies to revolt also.</p>

<p>This Hermeias was a Carian and had obtained his power
by the appointment of the king&#8217;s brother Seleucus, who had
entrusted it to him when he was setting out on his expedition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
to the Taurus. Invested with this authority he at once began
to display jealousy of all those about the court
who were in any way prominent; <span class="sidenote">Intrigues of
Hermeias.</span>
and being
cruel by nature he inflicted punishment on
some for acts of ignorance, on which he always managed
to place the worst interpretation; while against others he
brought trumped-up and lying charges, and then acted towards
them the part of an inflexible and harsh judge. But his chief
end and object was to secure the destruction of Epigenes who
had brought home the forces which had accompanied Seleucus;
because he saw that he was a man of eloquence and practical
ability, and highly acceptable to the army. With this design
he was ever on the watch to lay hold of some handle or
pretext against him. Accordingly when a council was
summoned on the subject of Molon&#8217;s revolt, and when the
king bade each councillor deliver his opinion on the measures
to be taken against the rebels, Epigenes spoke first and urged
that &#8220;there ought to be no delay, but the matter should be
taken in hand at once; and that, first and foremost, the king
should go in person to the district, and be ready to seize the
right moments for action. For the actual presence of the king,
and his appearance at the head of an army before the eyes of
the common people, would prevent the party of Molon from
venturing upon revolutionary measures at all; or if they had
the audacity to do so, and persisted in their design, they would
be quickly arrested by the populace and handed over into the
king&#8217;s power.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b5_42" id="b5_42"><b>42.</b></a> While Epigenes was still speaking in this strain,
Hermeias, in a burst of rage, exclaimed, &#8220;That Epigenes had
long been secretly plotting treason against the king; but that
now he had happily shown his real sentiments by the advice
which he had given, proving how eager he was to expose the
king&#8217;s person to the rebels with an insignificant guard.&#8221; For the
present he was content with making this insinuation as fuel for
a future outburst of slander, and without further reference to
Epigenes, after what was rather an ill-timed ebullition of temper
than serious hostility, he delivered his own opinion; which, from
his fear of the danger and his inexperience in war, was against
undertaking the expedition against Molon personally, but was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
warmly in favour of an attack upon Ptolemy, because he was
of opinion that this latter war would involve no danger, owing
to that monarch&#8217;s cowardly character. For the present he
overawed the rest of the council into agreement with him and
he thereupon sent Xenon and Theodotus Hemiolius with an
army against Molon; while he employed himself in continually
inciting Antiochus to undertake the expedition into Coele-Syria:
thinking that it was only by involving the young king in
war on every side that he could escape punishment for his
past misdeeds, and avoid being deprived of his position of
authority, for the king would have need of his services when
he found himself surrounded by struggles and dangers. With
this object in view, he finally hit on the device of forging a
letter, which he presented to the king as having been sent by
Achaeus. In it Achaeus was made to state that &#8220;Ptolemy
had urged him to assert his right to the government and promised
to supply him with ships and money for all his attempts,
if he would only take the crown, and come forward in the sight
of all the world as a claimant of the sovereign power; which
he already possessed, in fact, though he grudged himself the
title, and rejected the crown which fortune gave him.&#8221;</p>

<p>This letter successfully imposed on the king, who became
ready and eager to go on the expedition against Coele-Syria.</p>

<p><a name="b5_43" id="b5_43"><b>43.</b></a> While this was going on, Antiochus happened to be at
Seleucia, on the Zeugma, when the Navarchus
Diognetus arrived from Cappadocia, <span class="sidenote">Marriage of

on the
Euxine, bringing Laodice, the daughter of
king Mithridates, an unmarried girl, destined to be the king&#8217;s
wife. This Mithridates boasted of being a descendant of one
of the seven Persians who killed the Magus,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> and he had
maintained the sovereignty handed down from his ancestors,
as it had been originally given to them by Darius along the
shore of the Euxine. Having gone to meet the princess
with all due pomp and splendour, Antiochus immediately
celebrated his nuptials with royal magnificence. The marriage
having been completed, he went to Antioch, and after proclaiming
Laodice queen, devoted himself thenceforth to making
preparation for the war.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Molon had prepared the people of his own
Satrapy to go all lengths, partly by holding out
to them hopes of advantages to be gained, <span class="sidenote">Molon.</span>
and
partly by working on the fears of their chief men, by means of
forged letters purporting to be from the king, and couched in
threatening terms. He had also a ready coadjutor in his
brother Alexander; and had secured the co-operation of the
neighbouring Satrapies, by winning the goodwill of their leading
men with bribes. It was, therefore, at the head of a large
force that he took the field against the royal generals. Terrified
at his approach Xenon and Theodotus retired into the
cities; and Molon, having secured the territory of Apollonia,
had now a superabundance of supplies.</p>

<p><a name="b5_44" id="b5_44"><b>44.</b></a> But, indeed, even before that he was a formidable
enemy owing to the importance of his province. <span class="sidenote">Description of

and they have an incalculable quantity of corn and cattle.
Of the natural strength and extent of the district it would
be impossible to speak highly enough. For Media lies
nearly in the centre of Asia and in its size, and in the height
of its steppes compares favourably with every other district of
Asia. And again it overlooks some of the most warlike and
powerful tribes. On the east lie the plains of the desert
which intervenes between Persia and Parthia; and, moreover,
it borders on and commands the &#8220;Caspian Gates,&#8221; and touches
the mountains of the Tapyri, which are not far from the
Hyrcanian Sea. On the south it slopes down to Mesopotamia
and the territory of Apollonia. It is protected from Persia by
the barrier of Mount Zagrus, which has an ascent of a
hundred stades, and containing in its range many separate
peaks and defiles is subdivided by deep valleys, and at certain
points by ca&ntilde;ons, inhabited by Cosseans, Corbrenians, Carchi,
and several other barbarous tribes who have the reputation of
being excellent warriors. Again on the west it is coterminous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>with the tribe called Satrapeii, who are not far from the tribes
which extend as far as the Euxine. Its northern frontier is
fringed by Elymaeans, Aniaracae, Cadusii, and Matiani, and
overlooks that part of the Pontus which adjoins the Maeotis.
Media itself is subdivided by several mountain chains running
from east to west, between which are plains thickly studded
with cities and villages.</p>

<p><a name="b5_45" id="b5_45"><b>45.</b></a> Being masters, then, of a territory of proportions
worthy of a kingdom, his great power had
made Molon from the first a formidable
enemy: <span class="sidenote">Molon takes up
arms.</span>
but when the royal generals appeared
to have abandoned the country to him, and his own
forces were elated at the successful issue of their first hopes,
the terror which he inspired became absolute, and he was
believed by the Asiatics to be irresistible. Taking advantage
of this, he first of all resolved to cross the Tigris and lay siege
to Seleucia; but when his passage across the river was stopped
by Zeuxis seizing the river boats, he retired to the camp at
Ctesiphon, and set about preparing winter quarters for his army.</p>

<p>When King Antiochus heard of Molon&#8217;s advance and the
retreat of his own generals, he was once more for
giving up the expedition against Ptolemy, <span class="sidenote">Xenoetas sent
against Molon,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;221.</span>
and
going in person on the campaign against Molon,
and not letting slip the proper time for action. But Hermeias
persisted in his original plan, and despatched the Achaean
Xenoetas against Molon, in command of an army, with full
powers; asserting that against rebels it was fitting that generals
should have the command; but that the king ought to confine
himself to directing plans and conducting national wars against
monarchs. Having therefore the young king entirely in his
power, owing to his age, he set out; and having mustered the
army at Apameia he started thence and arrived
at Laodiceia. <span class="sidenote">King Antiochus
in Coele-Syria.</span>
Advancing from that
time with his whole army, the king crossed
the desert and entered the ca&ntilde;on called Marsyas, which lies
between the skirts of Libanus and Anti-Libanus, and is contracted
into a narrow gorge by those two mountains. Just
where the valley is narrowest it is divided by marshes and
lakes, from which the scented reed is cut.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b5_46" id="b5_46"><b>46.</b></a> On one side of the entrance to this pass lies a place called
Brochi, on the other Gerrha, which leave but a narrow space
between them. After a march of several days through this ca&ntilde;on,
and subduing the towns that lay along it, Antiochus arrived
at Gerrha. Finding that Theodotus the Aetolian had already
occupied Gerrha and Brochi, and had secured the narrow road
by the lakes with ditches and palisades and a proper disposition
of guards, the king at first tried to carry the pass by force;
but after sustaining more loss than he inflicted, and finding
that Theodotus remained still stanch, he gave up the
attempt. In the midst of these difficulties news was brought
that Xenoetas had suffered a total defeat and that Molon was
in possession of all the upper country: he therefore abandoned
his foreign expedition and started to relieve his own
dominions.</p>

<p>The fact was that when the general Xenoetas had been despatched
with absolute powers, as I have before <span class="sidenote">Xenoetas at first
successful.</span>
stated, his unexpected elevation caused him to
treat his friends with haughtiness and his
enemies with overweening temerity. His first move however
was sufficiently prudent. He marched to Seleucia, and after
sending for Diogenes the governor of Susiana, and Pythiades
the commander in the Persian Gulf, he led out his forces and
encamped with the river Tigris protecting his front. But there
he was visited by many men from Molon&#8217;s camp, who swam
across the river and assured him that, if he would only cross
the Tigris, the whole of Molon&#8217;s army would declare for him;
for the common soldiers were jealous of Molon and warmly
disposed towards the king. Xenoetas was encouraged by
these statements to attempt the passage of the Tigris. He
made a feint of bridging the river at a spot where it is divided
by an island; but as he was getting nothing ready for such an
operation, Molon took no notice of his pretended move; while
he was really occupied in collecting boats and getting them
ready with every possible care. Then having selected the most
courageous men, horse and foot, from his entire army, he left
Zeuxis and Pythiades in charge of his camp, and marched up
stream at night about eighty stades above Molon&#8217;s camp; and
having got his force safely over in boats, encamped them before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
daybreak in an excellent position, nearly surrounded by the
river, and covered where there was no river by marshes and
swamps.</p>

<p><a name="b5_47" id="b5_47"><b>47.</b></a> When Molon learnt what had taken place, he sent his
cavalry, under the idea that they would easily stop those who
were actually crossing, and ride down those who had already
crossed. But as soon as they got near Xenoetas&#8217;s force, their
ignorance of the ground proved fatal to them without any
enemy to attack them; for they got immersed by their own
weight, and sinking in the lakes were all rendered useless,
while many of them actually lost their lives. Xenoetas, however,
feeling sure that if he only approached, Molon&#8217;s forces
would all desert to him, advanced along the bank of the river and
pitched a camp close to the enemy. Thereupon Molon, either
as a stratagem, or because he really felt some doubt of the
fidelity of his men, and was afraid that some of Xenoetas&#8217;s
expectations might be fulfilled, left his baggage in his camp
and started under cover of night in the direction of Media.
Xenoetas, imagining that Molon had fled in terror at his approach,
and because he distrusted the fidelity of his own troops, first
attacked and took the enemy&#8217;s camp, and then sent for his own
cavalry and their baggage from the camp of Zeuxis. He next
summoned the soldiers to a meeting, and told them that they
should feel encouraged and hopeful now that Molon had fled.
With this preface, he ordered them all to attend to their bodily
wants and refresh themselves; as he intended without delay to
go in pursuit of the enemy early next morning.</p>

<p><a name="b5_48" id="b5_48"><b>48.</b></a> But the soldiers, filled with confidence, and enriched
with every kind of provisions, eagerly turned <span class="sidenote">Molon returns to
his camp.</span>
to feasting and wine and the demoralisation
which always accompanies such excesses.
But Molon, after marching a considerable distance, caused
his army to get their dinner, and then wheeling round
reappeared at the camp. He found all the enemy scattered
about and drunk, and attacked their palisade just before daybreak.
Dismayed by this unexpected danger, and unable to
awake his men from their drunken slumber, Xenoetas and his
staff rushed furiously upon the enemy and were killed. Of
the sleeping soldiers most were killed in their beds, while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
rest threw themselves into the river and endeavoured to cross
to the opposite camp. The greater part however even of
these perished; for in the blind hurry and confusion which
prevailed, and in the universal panic and dismay, seeing the
camp on the other side divided by so narrow a space, they all
forgot the violence of the stream, and the difficulty of crossing
it, in their eagerness to reach a place of safety. In wild
excitement therefore, and with a blind instinct of self-preservation,
they not only hurled themselves into the river,
but threw their beasts of burden in also, with their packs, as
though they thought that the river by some providential
instinct would take their part and convey them safely to the
opposite camp. The result was that the stream presented a
truly pitiable and extraordinary spectacle,&mdash;horses, beasts of
burden, arms, corpses, and every kind of baggage being carried
down the current along with the swimmers.</p>

<p>Having secured the camp of Xenoetas, Molon crossed the
river in perfect safety and without any resistance, <span class="sidenote">Molon&#8217;s successful
campaign.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;221.</span>
as Zeuxis also now fled at his approach;
took possession of the latter&#8217;s camp, and then
advanced with his whole army to Seleucia; carried it at the
first assault, Zeuxis and Diomedon the governor of the place
both abandoning it and flying; and advancing from this place
reduced the upper Satrapies to submission without a blow.
That of Babylon fell next, and then the Satrapy which lay along
the Persian Gulf. This brought him to Susa, which he also
carried without a blow; though his assaults upon the citadel
proved unavailing, because Diogenes the general had thrown himself
into it before he could get there. He therefore abandoned
the idea of carrying it by storm, and leaving a detachment to
lay siege to it, hurried back with his main army to Seleucia on
the Tigris. There he took great pains to refresh his army,
and after addressing his men in encouraging terms he started
once more to complete his designs, and occupied Parapotamia
as far as the city Europus, and Mesopotamia as far as Dura.</p>

<p><a name="b5_49" id="b5_49"><b>49.</b></a> When news of these events was brought to Antiochus, as
I have said before, he gave up all idea of the Coele-Syrian
campaign, and turned all his attention to this war. Another
meeting of his council was thereupon summoned: and on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
king ordering the members of it to deliver their opinions as to the
tactics to be employed against Molon, the first
to speak on the business was again Epigenes: <span class="sidenote">Epigenes put to
death by the
intrigues of
Hermeias.</span>
who said that &#8220;his advice should have been followed
all along, and measures have been promptly
taken before the enemy had obtained such important successes:
still even at this late hour they ought to take it in hand
resolutely.&#8221; Thereupon Hermeias broke out again into an
unreasonable and violent fit of anger and began to heap abuse
upon Epigenes; and while belauding himself in a fulsome
manner, brought accusations against Epigenes that were
absurd as well as false. He ended by adjuring the king not
to be diverted from his purpose without better reason, nor to
abandon his hopes in Coele-Syria. This advice was ill-received
by the majority of the council, and displeasing to Antiochus
himself; and, accordingly, as the king showed great anxiety to
reconcile the two men, Hermeias was at length induced to
put an end to his invectives. The council decided by a
majority that the course recommended by Epigenes was the
most practical and advantageous, and a resolution was come
to that the king should go on the campaign against Molon,
and devote his attention to that. Thereupon Hermeias
promptly made a hypocritical pretence of having changed his
mind and remarking that it was the duty of all to acquiesce
loyally in the decision, made a great show of readiness and
activity in pushing on the preparations.</p>

<p><a name="b5_50" id="b5_50"><b>50.</b></a> The forces, however, having been mustered at Apameia,
upon a kind of mutiny arising among the common soldiers,
on account of some arrears of pay, Hermeias, observing the
king to be in a state of anxiety, and to be alarmed at the
disturbance at so critical a moment, offered to discharge all
arrears, if the king would only consent to Epigenes not
accompanying the expedition; on the ground that nothing
could be properly managed in the army when such angry
feelings, and such party spirit, had been excited. The proposal
was very displeasing to the king, who was exceedingly anxious
that Epigenes should accompany him on the campaign, owing
to his experience in the field; but he was bound so
completely hand and foot, and entangled by the craft of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
Hermeias, his skilful finance, constant watchfulness, and
designing flattery, that he was not his own master; and
accordingly he yielded to the necessity of the moment and
consented to his demand. When Epigenes thereupon retired,
as he was bidden, the members of the council were too much
afraid of incurring displeasure to remonstrate; while the army
generally, by a revulsion of feeling, turned with gratitude to
the man to whom they owed the settlement of their claims
for pay. The Cyrrhestae were the only ones that stood out:
and they broke out into open mutiny, and for some time
occasioned much trouble; but, being at last conquered by one
of the king&#8217;s generals, most of them were killed, and the rest
submitted to the king&#8217;s mercy. Hermeias having thus secured
the allegiance of his friends by fear, and of the troops by
being of service to them, started on the expedition in company
with the king; while in regard to Epigenes he elaborated the
following plot, with the assistance of Alexis, the commander
of the citadel of Apameia. He wrote a letter purporting to have
been sent from Molon to Epigenes, and persuaded one of the
latter&#8217;s servants, by holding out the hope of great rewards, to
take it to the house of Epigenes, and mix it with his other
papers. Immediately after this had been done, Alexis came
to the house and asked Epigenes whether he had not received
certain letters from Molon; and, upon his denial, demanded in
menacing terms to be allowed to search. Having entered, he
quickly discovered the letter, which he availed himself of as a
pretext for putting Epigenes to death on the spot. By this
means the king was persuaded to believe that Epigenes had
justly forfeited his life; and though the courtiers had their
suspicions, they were afraid to say anything.</p>

<p><a name="b5_51" id="b5_51"><b>51.</b></a> When Antiochus had reached the Euphrates, and had
taken over the force stationed there, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;221-220.
Antiochus advances
through
Mesopotamia.</span>he once
more started on his march and got as far as Antioch,
in Mygdonia, about mid-winter, and there
remained until the worst of the winter should
be over. Thence after a stay of forty days he advanced to
Libba. Molon was now in the neighbourhood of Babylon:
and Antiochus consulted his council as to the route to be
pursued, the tactics to be adopted, and the source from which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
provisions could best be obtained for his army on the march
in their expedition against Molon. The proposal of Hermeias
was to march along the Tigris, with this river, and the Lycus
and Caprus, on their flank. Zeuxis, having the fate of
Epigenes before his eyes, was in a state of painful doubt
whether to speak his real opinion or no; but as the mistake
involved in the advice of Hermeias was flagrant, he at last
mustered courage to advise that the Tigris should be crossed;
alleging as a reason the general difficulty of the road along
the river: especially from the fact that, after a considerable
march, the last six days of which would be through a desert,
they would reach what was called the &#8220;King&#8217;s Dyke,&#8221; which it
would be impossible to cross if they found it invested by the
enemy; while a retirement by a second march through the
wilderness would be manifestly dangerous, especially as their
provisions would be sure to be running short. On the other
hand he showed that if they crossed the Tigris it was evident
the Apolloniates would repent of their treason and join the
king; for even as it was they had submitted to Molon, not from
choice, but under compulsion and terror; and the fertility of
their soil promised abundance of provisions for the troops.
But his most weighty argument was that by their thus acting
Molon would be cut off from a return to Media, and from
drawing supplies from that country, and would thereby be
compelled to risk a general action: or, if he refused to do so,
his troops would promptly fix their hopes upon the king.</p>

<p><a name="b5_52" id="b5_52"><b>52.</b></a> The suggestion of Zeuxis being approved, the army was
immediately arranged in three divisions, <span class="sidenote">Antiochus crosses
the Tigris.</span>
and got
across with the baggage at three points in the
river. Thence they marched in the direction
of Dura, where they quickly caused the siege of the citadel to be
raised, which was being invested at the time by some of Molon&#8217;s
officers; and thence, after a march of eight successive days, they
crossed the mountain called Oreicum and arrived at Apollonia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Molon had heard of the king&#8217;s arrival, and not
feeling confidence in the inhabitants of Susiana and Babylonia,
because he had conquered them so recently and by surprise,
fearing also to be cut off from a retreat to Media, he determined
to throw a bridge over the Tigris and get his army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
across; being eager if it were possible to secure the mountain
district of Apollonia, because he had great confidence in his
corps of slingers called Cyrtii. <span class="sidenote">Molon also
crosses the Tigris.</span>
He carried out
his resolution, and was pushing forward in an
unbroken series of forced marches. Thus it
came about that, just as he was entering the district of
Apollonia, the king at the head of his whole army was marching
out. The advanced guard of skirmishers of the two armies
fell in with each other on some high ground, and at first
engaged and made trial of each other&#8217;s strength; but upon the
main armies on either side coming on to the ground, they
separated. For the present both retired to their respective
entrenchments, and encamped at a distance of forty stades
from each other. <span class="sidenote">Abortive attempt
of Molon to make
a night attack on
the king.</span>
When night had fallen, Molon reflected that
there was some risk and disadvantage in a battle
by broad daylight and in the open field between
rebels and their sovereign, and he determined
therefore to attack Antiochus by night. Selecting
the best and most vigorous of his soldiers, he made a considerable
detour, with the object of making his attack from
higher ground. But having learnt during his march that ten
young men had deserted in a body to the king, he gave up his
design, and facing right about returned in haste to his own
entrenchment where he arrived about daybreak. His arrival
caused a panic in the army; for the troops in the camp,
startled out of their sleep by the arrival of the returning men,
were very near rushing out of the lines.</p>

<p><a name="b5_53" id="b5_53"><b>53.</b></a> But while Molon was doing his best to calm the panic,
the king, fully prepared for the engagement, <span class="sidenote">Disposition of the
king&#8217;s army.</span>
was
marching his whole army out of their lines at
daybreak. On his right wing he stationed his
lancers under the command of Ardys, a man of proved ability
in the field; next to them the Cretan allies, and next the
Gallic Rhigosages. Next these he placed the foreign contingent
and mercenary soldiers from Greece, and next to them
he stationed his phalanx: the left wing he assigned to the
cavalry called the &#8220;Companions.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> His elephants, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>were ten in number, he placed at intervals in front of
the line. His reserves of infantry and cavalry he divided
between the two wings, with orders to outflank the enemy as
soon as the battle had begun. He then went along the line
and addressed a few words of exhortation to the men suitable
to the occasion; and put Hermeias and Zeuxis in command
of the left wing, taking that of the right himself.</p>

<p>On the other side, owing to the panic caused by his rash
movement of the previous night, Molon was unable
to get his men out of camp, <span class="sidenote">Molon&#8217;s disposition.</span>
or into position
without difficulty and confusion. He did
however divide his cavalry between his two wings, guessing
what the disposition of the enemy would be; and stationed
the scutati and Gauls, and in short all his heavy-armed
men in the space between the two bodies of cavalry. His
archers, slingers, and all such kind of troops he placed
on the outer flank of the cavalry on either wing; while
his scythed chariots he placed at intervals in front of his line.
He gave his brother Neolaus command of the left wing, taking
that of the right himself.</p>

<p><a name="b5_54" id="b5_54"><b>54.</b></a> When the two armies advanced to the battle, Molon&#8217;s
right wing remained faithful to him, and
vigorously engaged the division of Zeuxis; <span class="sidenote">Death of Molon
and his fellow-conspirators.</span>
but
the left wing no sooner came within sight of
the king than it deserted to the enemy: the result of which
was that Molon&#8217;s army was thrown into consternation, while
the king&#8217;s troops were inspired with redoubled confidence.
When Molon comprehended what had taken place, and found
himself surrounded on every side, reflecting on the tortures
which would be inflicted upon him if he were taken alive, he
put an end to his own life. So too all who had taken part in the
plot fled severally to their own homes, and terminated their
lives in the same way. Neolaus escaped from the field and
found his way into Persis, to the house of Molon&#8217;s brother
Alexander; and there first killed his mother and Molon&#8217;s children
and afterwards himself, having previously persuaded Alexander
to do the same to himself. After plundering the enemy&#8217;s
camp, the king ordered the body of Molon to be impaled on
the most conspicuous spot in Media: which the men appointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
to the work immediately did; for they took it to Callonitis
and impaled it close to the pass over Mount Zagrus. The
king, after plundering the enemy&#8217;s camp, rebuked the rebel
army in a long speech; and finally receiving them back into
favour by holding out his right hand to them, appointed certain
officers to lead them back to Media and settle the affairs of
that district; while he himself went down to Seleucia and
made arrangements for the government of the Satrapies round
it, treating all with equal clemency and prudence. But Hermeias
acted with his usual harshness: he got up charges
against the people of Seleucia, and imposed a fine of a thousand
talents upon the city; drove their magistrates, called
Adeiganes, into exile; and put many Seleucians to death with
various tortures, by mutilation, the sword and the rack. With
great difficulty, sometimes by dissuading Hermeias, and sometimes
by interposing his own authority, the king did at length
put an end to these severities; and, exacting only a fine of a
hundred and fifty talents from the citizens for the error they
had committed, restored the city to a state of order. This
being done, he left Diogenes in command of Media, and
Apollodorus of Susiana; and sent Tychon, his chief military
secretary, to command the district along the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Thus was the rebellion of Molon and the rising in the
upper Satrapies suppressed and quieted.</p>

<p><a name="b5_55" id="b5_55"><b>55.</b></a> Elated by his success, and wishing to strike awe and
terror into the minds of the princes of the

expedition. The
treasonable
designs of Hermeias.</span>
or conterminous
with his own Satrapies, that they might never
venture to aid by supplies or arms those who
revolted from him, he determined to march
against them. And first of all against Artabazanes, who
appeared to be the most formidable and able of
all the princes, and who ruled over a tribe called
the Satrapeii, and others on their borders. But Hermeias was
at that time afraid of an expedition further up country, owing to
its danger; and was always yearning for the expedition against
Ptolemy in accordance with his original plan. When news,
however, came that a son had been born to the king, thinking
that Antiochus might possibly fall by the hands of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
barbarians in upper Asia, or give him opportunities of putting
him out of the way, he consented to the expedition; believing
that, if he could only effect the death of Antiochus, he would
be guardian to his son and so sole master of the whole kingdom.
This having been decided, <span class="sidenote">Artabazanes.</span>
the army crossed Mount
Zagrus and entered the territory of Artabazanes, which borders
on Media, and is separated from it by an intervening chain of
mountains. Part of it overlooks the Pontus, near the valley
of the Phasis; and it extends to the Hyrcanian Sea. Its
inhabitants are numerous and warlike and especially strong in
horsemen; while the district produces within itself all other
things necessary for war. The dynasty has lasted from the
time of the Persians, having been overlooked at the period
of Alexander&#8217;s conquests. But now in great alarm at the king&#8217;s
approach, and at his own infirmities, for he was an extremely
old man, Artabazanes yielded to the force of circumstances,
and made a treaty with Antiochus on his own terms.</p>

<p><a name="b5_56" id="b5_56"><b>56.</b></a> It was after the settlement of this treaty that Apollophanes,
the physician, who was regarded with
great affection by the king, <span class="sidenote">Fall and death
of Hermeias,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220.</span>
observing that Hermeias
was getting beyond all bounds in his
high place, began to be anxious for the king&#8217;s safety, and still
more suspicious and uneasy for his own. He took an
opportunity, therefore, of conveying a suggestion to the king,
that he had better not be too careless or unsuspicious of the
audacious character of Hermeias; nor let things go on until he
found himself involved in a disaster like that of his brother.
&#8220;The danger,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is not at all remote.&#8221; And he
begged him to be on his guard, and take prompt measures for
the safety of himself and his friends. Antiochus owned to
him that he disliked and feared Hermeias; and thanked him
for the care of his person, which had emboldened him to
speak to him on the subject. This conversation encouraged
Apollophanes by convincing him that he had not been
mistaken about the feelings and opinions of the king; and
Antiochus begged him not to confine his assistance to words,
but to take some practical steps to secure the safety of himself
and his friends. Upon Apollophanes replying that he
was ready to do anything in the world, they concerted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
following plan. On the pretext of the king being afflicted
with an attack of vertigo, it was given out that the daily
attendance of courtiers and officials was to be discontinued
for a few days: the king and his physician thus getting the
opportunity of conferring with such of his friends as he chose,
who came on the pretext of visiting him. In the course of
these visits suitable persons for carrying out the design were
prepared and instructed; and every one readily responding to
the proposal, from hatred of Hermeias, they proceeded to
complete it. The physicians having prescribed walks at daybreak
for Antiochus on account of the coolness, Hermeias
came to the place assigned for the walk, and with him those of
the king&#8217;s friends who were privy to the design; while the rest
were much too late on account of the time of the king&#8217;s
coming out being very different from what it had usually been.
Thus they got Hermeias gradually a considerable distance
from the camp, until they came to a certain lonely spot, and
then, on the king&#8217;s going a little off the road, on the pretence
of a necessary purpose, they stabbed him to death. Such was
the end of Hermeias, whose punishment was by no means
equal to his crimes. Thus freed from much fear and
embarrassment, the king set out on his march home amidst
universal manifestations from the people of the country in
favour of his measures and policy; but nothing was more
emphatically applauded in the course of his progress than the
removal of Hermeias. In Apameia, at the same time, the
women stoned the wife of Hermeias to death, and the boys
his sons.</p>

<p><a name="b5_57" id="b5_57"><b>57.</b></a> When he had reached home and had dismissed his
troops into winter quarters, Antiochus sent a message to Achaeus,
protesting against his assumption of the diadem and royal
title, and warning him that he was aware of his dealings with
Ptolemy, and of his restless intrigues generally. <span class="sidenote">Attempted treason
of Achaeus.</span>
For while the king was engaged on his expedition
against Artabazanes, Achaeus, being persuaded
that Antiochus would fall, or that, if he did not fall,
would be so far off, that it would be possible for him to
invade Syria before his return, and with the assistance of the
Cyrrhestae, who were in revolt against the king, seize the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
kingdom, started from Lydia with his whole army; and on
arriving at Laodiceia, in Phrygia, assumed the diadem, and
had the audacity for the first time to adopt the title of king, and
to send royal despatches to the cities, the exile Garsyeris being
his chief adviser in this measure. But as he advanced farther
and farther, and was now almost at Lycaonia, a mutiny broke
out among his forces, arising from the dissatisfaction of the men
at the idea of being led against their natural king. When
Achaeus found that this disturbed state of feeling existed
among them, he desisted from his enterprise; and wishing to
make his men believe that he had never had any intention of
invading Syria, he directed his march into Pisidia, and
plundered the country. By thus securing large booty for his
army he conciliated its affection and confidence, and then
returned to his own Satrapy.</p>

<p><a name="b5_58" id="b5_58"><b>58.</b></a> Every detail of these transactions was known to the king:
who, while sending frequent threatening messages to Achaeus,
was now concentrating all his efforts on the preparations for
the war against Ptolemy. <span class="sidenote">War with Ptolemy,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;219.</span>
Having accordingly
mustered his forces at Apameia just before
spring, he summoned his friends to advise with
him as to the invasion of Coele-Syria. After many suggestions
had been made in respect to this undertaking, touching the
nature of the country, the military preparation required, and
the assistance to be rendered by the fleet,&mdash;Apollophanes of
Seleucia, whom I mentioned before, <span class="sidenote">Apollophanes
advises that they
begin by taking
Seleucia.</span>
put an abrupt end to all
these suggestions by remarking that &#8220;it was folly
to desire Coele-Syria and to march against that,
while they allowed Seleucia to be held by
Ptolemy, which was the capital, and so to speak,
the very inner shrine of the king&#8217;s realm. Besides the disgrace
to the kingdom which its occupation by the Egyptian monarchs
involved, it was a position of the greatest practical importance,
as a most admirable base of operations. Occupied by the
enemy it was of the utmost hindrance to all the king&#8217;s designs;
for in whatever direction he might have it in his mind to move
his forces, his own country, owing to the fear of danger from
this place, would need as much care and precaution as the
preparations against his foreign enemies. Once taken, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
other hand, not only would it perfectly secure the safety of
the home district, but was also capable of rendering effective
aid to the king&#8217;s other designs and undertakings, whether by
land or sea, owing to its commanding situation.&#8221; His words
carried conviction to the minds of all, and it was resolved
that the capture of the town should be their first step. For
Seleucia was still held by a garrison for the Egyptian kings;
and had been so since the time of Ptolemy Euergetes, who
took it when he invaded Syria to revenge the murder of
Berenice.</p>

<p><a name="b5_59" id="b5_59"><b>59.</b></a> In consequence of this decision, orders were sent to
Diognetus the commander of the fleet to sail towards Seleucia:
while Antiochus himself started from Apameia with his army,
and encamped near the Hippodrome, about five stades from
the town. He also despatched Theodotus Hemiolius with an
adequate force against Coele-Syria, with orders to occupy the
passes and to keep the road open for him.</p>

<p>The situation of Seleucia and the natural features of the
surrounding country are of this kind. <span class="sidenote">Description of
Seleucia.</span>
The city
stands on the sea coast between Cilicia and
Phoenicia; and has close to it a very great
mountain called Coryphaeus, which on the west is washed by
the last waves of the sea which lies between Cyprus and
Phoenicia; while its eastern slopes overlook the territories of
Antioch and Seleucia. It is on the southern skirt of this
mountain that the town of Seleucia lies, separated from it by
a deep and difficult ravine. The town extends down to the
sea in a straggling line broken by irregularities of the soil, and
is surrounded on most parts by cliffs and precipitous rocks.
On the side facing the sea, where the ground is level, stand
the market-places, and the lower town strongly walled. Similarly
the whole of the main town has been fortified by walls of a
costly construction, and splendidly decorated with temples and
other elaborate buildings. There is only one approach to it
on the seaward side, which is an artificial ascent cut in the
form of a stair, interrupted by frequently occurring drops and
awkward places. Not far from the town is the mouth of the
river Orontes, which rises in the district of Libanus and
Anti-Libanus, and after traversing the plain of Amyca reaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Antioch; through which it flows, and carrying off by the force
of its current all the sewage of that town, finally discharges
itself into this sea not far from Seleucia.</p>

<p><a name="b5_60" id="b5_60"><b>60.</b></a> Antiochus first tried sending messages to the magistrates
of Seleucia, offering money and other
rewards on condition of having the city surrendered
without fighting. <span class="sidenote">Capture of
Seleucia.</span>
And though he
failed to persuade the chief authorities, he corrupted some of
the subordinate commanders; and relying on them, he made
preparations to assault the town on the seaward side with the
men of his fleet, and on the land side with his soldiers. He
divided his forces therefore into three parts, and addressed
suitable words of exhortation to them, causing a herald to
proclaim a promise to men and officers alike of great gifts and
crowns that should be bestowed for gallantry in action. To
the division under Zeuxis he entrusted the attack upon the
gate leading to Antioch; to Hermogenes that upon the walls
near the temple of Castor and Pollux; and to Ardys and
Diognetus the assault upon the docks and the lower town: in
accordance with his understanding with his partisans in the
town, whereby it had been agreed that, if he could carry the
lower town by assault, the city also should then be put into his
hands. When the signal was given, a vigorous and determined
assault was begun simultaneously at all these points: though
that made by Ardys and Diognetus was by far the most daring;
for the other points did not admit of any assault at all by
means of scaling ladders, nor could be carried except by the men
climbing up on their hands and knees; while at the docks and
lower town it was possible to apply scaling ladders and fix
them firmly and safely against the walls. The naval contingent
therefore having fixed their ladders on the docks, and
the division of Ardys theirs upon the lower town, a violent
effort was made to carry the walls: and the garrison of the
upper town being prevented from coming to the assistance of
these places, because the city was being assaulted at every
other point at the same time, Ardys was not long before he
captured the lower town. No sooner had this fallen, than the
subordinate officers who had been corrupted hurried to the
commander-in-chief Leontius, and urged that he ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
send ambassadors to Antiochus, and make terms with him,
before the city was taken by storm. Knowing nothing about
the treason of these officers, but alarmed by their consternation,
Leontius sent commissioners to the king to make terms for
the safety of all within the city.</p>

<p><a name="b5_61" id="b5_61"><b>61.</b></a> The king accepted the proposal and agreed to grant
safety to all in the town who were free, amounting to six
thousand souls. And when he took over the town, he not
only spared the free, but also recalled those of the inhabitants
who had been exiled, and restored to them their citizenship
and property; while he secured the harbour and citadel with
garrisons.</p>

<p>While still engaged in this business, he received a letter
from Theodotus offering to put Coele-Syria
into his hands, <span class="sidenote">Theodotus turns
against Ptolemy.
See ch. <a href="#b5_46">46</a>.</span>
and inviting him to come
thither with all speed. This letter caused
him great embarrassment and doubt as to what he ought
to do, and how best to take advantage of the offer. This
Theodotus was an Aetolian who, as I have already narrated,
had rendered important services to Ptolemy&#8217;s kingdom: for
which, far from being reckoned deserving of gratitude, he had
been in imminent danger of his life, just about the time of the
expedition of Antiochus against Molon. Thereupon conceiving
a contempt for Ptolemy, and a distrust of his courtiers,
he seized upon Ptolemais with his own hands, and upon Tyre by
the agency of Panaetolus, and made haste to invite Antiochus.
Postponing therefore his expedition against Achaeus, and regarding
everything else as of secondary importance, Antiochus
started with his army by the same route as he had come.
After passing the ca&ntilde;on called Marsyas, he encamped near
Gerrha, close to the lake which lies between the two mountains.
Hearing there that Ptolemy&#8217;s general Nicolaus was besieging
Theodotus in Ptolemais, he left his heavy-armed troops
behind with orders to their leaders to besiege Brochi,&mdash;the
stronghold which commands the road along the lake,&mdash;and
led his light-armed troops forward himself, with the intention
of raising the siege of Ptolemais. But Nicolaus had already
got intelligence of the king&#8217;s approach; and had accordingly
retired from Ptolemais himself, and sent forward Diogoras the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Cretan and Dorymenes the Aetolian to occupy the passes at
Berytus. The king therefore attacked these men, and having
easily routed them took up a position near the pass.</p>

<p><a name="b5_62" id="b5_62"><b>62.</b></a> There he awaited the coming up of the remainder
of his forces, and, after addressing them in
words befitting the occasion, <span class="sidenote">Antiochus invades
Coele-Syria.</span>
continued his
advance with his entire army, full of courage
and with high hopes of success. When Theodotus and
Panaetolus met him with their partisans he received them
graciously, and took over from them Tyre and Ptolemais, and
the war material which those cities contained. Part of this
consisted of forty vessels, of which twenty were decked and
splendidly equipped, and none with less than four banks of
oars; the other twenty were made up of triremes, biremes,
and cutters. These he handed over to the care of the
Navarch Diognetus; and being informed that Ptolemy had
come out against him, and had reached Memphis, and that all
his forces were collected at Pelusium, and were opening the
sluices, and filling up the wells of drinking water, he abandoned
the idea of attacking Pelusium; but making a progress through
the several cities, endeavoured to win them over by force or
persuasion to his authority. Some of the less-fortified cities
were overawed at his approach and made no difficulty about
submitting, but others trusting to their fortifications or the
strength of their situations held out; and to these he was
forced to lay regular siege and so wasted a considerable time.</p>

<p>Though treated with such flagrant perfidy, the character of
Ptolemy was so feeble, and his neglect of all military preparations
had been so great, that the idea of protecting his rights
with the sword, which was his most obvious duty, never
occurred to him.</p>

<p><a name="b5_63" id="b5_63"><b>63.</b></a> Agathocles and Sosibius, however, the leading ministers
in the kingdom at that time, took counsel
together and did the best they could with
the means at their disposal, <span class="sidenote">Active measures
of Agathocles
and Sosibius.</span>in view of the
existing crisis. They resolved to devote themselves to the
preparations for war; and, meanwhile, by embassies to
try to retard the advance of Antiochus: pretending to confirm
him in the opinion he originally entertained about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
Ptolemy, namely, that he would not venture to fight, but would
trust to negotiations, and the interposition of common friends,
to induce him to evacuate Coele-Syria. Having determined
upon this policy, Agathocles and Sosibius, to whom the whole
business was entrusted, lost no time in sending their ambassadors
to Antiochus: and at the same time they sent messages to
Rhodes, Byzantium, and Cyzicus, not omitting the Aetolians,
inviting them to send commissioners to discuss the terms of a
treaty. The commissioners duly arrived, and by occupying
the time with going backwards and forwards between the two
kings, abundantly secured to these statesmen the two things
which they wanted,&mdash;delay, and time to make their preparations
for war. They fixed their residence at Memphis and
there carried on these negotiations continuously. Nor were
they less attentive to the ambassadors from Antiochus, whom
they received with every mark of courtesy and kindness. But
meanwhile they were calling up and collecting at Alexandria
the mercenaries whom they had on service in towns outside
Egypt; were despatching men to recruit foreign soldiers;
and were collecting provisions both for the troops they already
possessed, and for those that were coming in. No less active
were they in every other department of the military preparations.
They took turns in going on rapid and frequent visits
to Alexandria, to see that the supplies should in no point be
inadequate to the undertaking before them. The manufacture
of arms, the selection of men, and their division into companies,
they committed to the care of Echecrates of Thessaly and
Phoxidas of Melita. With these they associated Eurylochus
of Magnesia, and Socrates of Boeotia, who were also joined by
Cnopias of Allaria. By the greatest good fortune they had
got hold of these officers, who, while serving with Demetrius
and Antigonus,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> had acquired some experience of real war and
actual service in the field. Accordingly they took command
of the assembled troops, and made the best of them by giving
them the training of soldiers.</p>

<p><a name="b5_64" id="b5_64"><b>64.</b></a> Their first measure was to divide them according to
their country and age, and to assign to each division its
appropriate arms, taking no account of what they had borne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
before. Next they broke up their battalions and muster-rolls,
which had been formed on the basis
of their old system of pay, <span class="sidenote">Reorganisation
of the army.</span>
and formed
them into companies adapted to the immediate purpose.
Having effected this they began to drill the men; habituating
them severally not only to obey the words of command,
but also to the proper management of their weapons.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>
They also frequently summoned general meetings at headquarters,
and delivered speeches to the men. The most
useful in this respect were Andromachus of Aspendus and
Polycrates of Argos; because they had recently crossed from
Greece, and were still thoroughly imbued with the Greek
spirit, and the military ideas prevalent in the several states.
Moreover, they were illustrious on the score of their private
wealth, as well as on that of their respective countries; to
which advantages Polycrates added those of an ancient family,
and of the reputation obtained by his father Mnasiades as an
athlete. By private and public exhortations these officers
inspired their men with a zeal and enthusiasm for the struggle
which awaited them.</p>

<p><a name="b5_65" id="b5_65"><b>65.</b></a> All these officers, too, had commands in the army
suited to their particular accomplishments. Eurylochus
of Magnesia commanded about three thousand men of what
were called in the royal armies the Agema, or Guard;
Socrates of Boeotia had two thousand light-armed troops under
him; while the Achaean Phoxidas, and Ptolemy the son of
Thraseas, and Andromachus of Aspendus were associated in
the duty of drilling the phalanx and the mercenary Greek
soldiers on the same ground,&mdash;Andromachus and Ptolemy
commanding the phalanx, Phoxidas the mercenaries; of which
the numbers were respectively twenty-five thousand and eight
thousand. The cavalry, again, attached to the court, amounting
to seven hundred, as well as that which was obtained from
Lybia or enlisted in the country, were being trained by
Polycrates, and were under his personal command: amounting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>in all to about three thousand men. In the actual campaign the
most effective service was performed by Echecrates of Thessaly,
by whom the Greek cavalry, which, with the whole body of mercenary
cavalry, amounted to two thousand men, was splendidly
trained. No one took more pains with the men under his
command than Cnopias of Allaria. He commanded all the
Cretans, who numbered three thousand, and among them a
thousand Neo-Cretans,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> over whom he had set Philo of Cnossus.
They also armed three thousand Libyans in the Macedonian
fashion, who were commanded by Ammonius of Barce. The
Egyptians themselves supplied twenty thousand soldiers to the
phalanx, and were under the command of Sosibius. A body
of Thracians and Gauls was also enrolled, four thousand being
taken from settlers in the country and their descendants, while
two thousand had been recently enlisted and brought over:
and these were under the command of Dionysius of Thrace.
Such in its numbers, and in the variety of the elements of which
it was composed, was the force which was being got ready for
Ptolemy.</p>

<p><a name="b5_66" id="b5_66"><b>66.</b></a> Meanwhile Antiochus had been engaged in the
siege of Dura:<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> but the strength of the
place and the support given it by Nicolaus <span class="sidenote">Negotiations at
Memphis, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
219-218.</span>
prevented him from effecting anything; and as
the winter was closing in, he agreed with the ambassadors of
Ptolemy to a suspension of hostilities for four months, and
promised that he would discuss the whole question at issue in
a friendly spirit. But he was as far as possible from being
sincere in this negotiation: his real object was to avoid being
detained any length of time from his own country, and to be
able to place his troops in winter quarters in Seleucia; because
Achaeus was now notoriously plotting against him, and without
disguise co-operating with Ptolemy. So having come to this
agreement, Antiochus dismissed the ambassadors with injunctions
to acquaint him as soon as possible with the decision of
Ptolemy, and to meet him at Seleucia. He then placed the
necessary guards in the various strongholds, committed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>Theodotus the command-in-chief over them all, and returned
home. On his arrival at Seleucia he distributed his forces
into their winter quarters; and from that time forth took
no pains to keep the mass of his army under discipline, being
persuaded that the business would not call for any more
fighting; because he was already master of some portions of
Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and expected to secure the rest by
voluntary submission or by diplomacy: for Ptolemy, he believed,
would not venture upon a general engagement. This opinion
was shared also by the ambassadors: because Sosibius fixing
his residence at Memphis conducted his negotiations with
them in a friendly manner; while he prevented those who went
backwards and forwards to Antiochus from ever becoming eye-witnesses
of the preparations that were being carried on at
Alexandria. Nay, even by the time that the ambassadors
arrived, Sosibius was already prepared for every eventuality.</p>

<p><a name="b5_67" id="b5_67"><b>67.</b></a> Meanwhile Antiochus was extremely anxious to have
as much the advantage over the government <span class="sidenote">Antiochus&#8217;s case.</span>
of Alexandria in diplomatic argument as
he had in arms. Accordingly when the ambassadors
arrived at Seleucia, and both parties began, in accordance
with the instructions of Sosibius, to discuss the clauses
of the proposed arrangement in detail, the king made very
light of the loss recently sustained by Ptolemy, and the
injury which had been manifestly inflicted upon him by the
existing occupation of Coele-Syria; and in the pleadings on
this subject he refused to look upon this transaction in the light
of an injury at all, alleging that the places belonged to him of
right. He asserted that the original occupation of the country
by Antigonus the One-eyed, and the royal authority exercised
over it by Seleucus,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> constituted an absolutely decisive and
equitable claim, <span class="sidenote">Ptolemy, son of
Lagus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;323-285.</span>
in virtue of which Coele-Syria
belonged of right to himself and not to
Ptolemy; for Ptolemy I. went to war with
Antigonus with the view of annexing this country, not to his
own government, but to that of Seleucus. But, above all, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
pressed the convention entered into by the three kings,
Cassander, Lysimachus, and Seleucus, when, after having
conquered Antigonus,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> they deliberated in common upon the
arrangements to be made, and decided that the whole of Syria
should belong to Seleucus. The commissioners of Ptolemy
endeavoured to establish the opposite case. They magnified
the existing injury, and dilated on its hardship; <span class="sidenote">Ptolemy&#8217;s case.</span>
asserting that the treason of Theodotus and the
invasion of Antiochus amounted to a breach of treaty-rights.
They alleged the possession of these places in the reign of
Ptolemy, son of Lagus; and tried to show that Ptolemy had
joined Seleucus in the war on the understanding that he was
to invest Seleucus with the government of the whole of Asia,
but was to take Coele-Syria and Phoenicia for himself.</p>

<p>Such were the arguments brought forward by the two
contracting parties in the course of the embassies and counter-embassies
and conferences. There was no prospect, however,
of arriving at any result, because the controversy was conducted,
not by the principals, but by the common friends of both; and
there was no one to intervene authoritatively to check and
control the caprice of the party which they might decide to be
in the wrong. But what caused the most insuperable difficulty
was the matter of Achaeus. For Ptolemy was eager that the
terms of the treaty should include him: while Antiochus would
not allow the subject to be so much as mentioned; and was
indignant that Ptolemy should venture to protect rebels, or
bring such a point into the discussion at all.</p>

<p><a name="b5_68" id="b5_68"><b>68.</b></a> The approach of spring found both sides weary of
negotiations, and with no prospect of coming to
a conclusion. <span class="sidenote">Renewal of hostilities,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218.</span>
Antiochus therefore began collecting
his forces, with a view of making an invasion
by land and sea, and completing his conquest of Coele-Syria.
On his part Ptolemy gave the supreme management of the war
to Nicolaus, sent abundant provisions to Gaza, and despatched
land and sea forces. The arrival of these reinforcements gave
Nicolaus courage to enter upon the war: the commander of
the navy promptly co-operating with him in carrying out all his
orders. This admiral was Perigenes, whom Ptolemy sent out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>in command of the fleet, consisting of thirty fully decked ships
and more than four thousand ships of burden. Nicolaus was
by birth an Aetolian, and was the boldest and most experienced
officer in the service of Ptolemy. With one division of his
army he hastened to seize the pass at Platanus; with the rest,
which he personally commanded, he occupied the environs of
Porphyrion; and there prepared to resist the invasion of the
king: the fleet being also anchored close to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Antiochus had advanced as far as Marathus.
On his way he had received a deputation
of Aradians, <span class="sidenote">Antiochus marches
to Beir&ucirc;t.</span>
asking for an alliance; and had
not only granted their request, but had put
an end to a quarrel which they had amongst themselves,
by reconciling those of them who lived on the island with
those who lived on the mainland. Starting from Marathus
he entered the enemy&#8217;s country near the promontory called
Theoprosopon, and advanced to Berytus, having seized Botrys
on his way, and burnt Trieres and Calamus. From Berytus he
sent forward Nicarchus and Theodotus with orders to secure
the difficult passes near the river Lyons; while he himself set
his army in motion and encamped near the river Damuras:
Diognetus, the commander of his navy, coasting along parallel
with him all the while. Thence once more, taking with him
the divisions commanded by Theodotus and Nicarchus, which
were the light troops of the army, he set out to reconnoitre
the pass occupied already by Nicolaus. After thoroughly
surveying the nature of the ground, he retired to his camp for
that day. But on the next, leaving his heavy-armed troops in
the charge of Nicarchus, he set out with the rest of his forces
to execute his design.</p>

<p><a name="b5_69" id="b5_69"><b>69.</b></a> At this point there is but a small and narrow space
between the foot of Libanus and the sea; <span class="sidenote">The pass at
Porphyrion.</span>
and even that is intersected by a steep
and rugged spur, leaving only a narrow and
difficult passage along the very water&#8217;s edge. On this pass
Nicolaus had taken up his position; and having occupied some
of the points by means of his large numbers, and secured
others by artificial works, he felt certain that he would be
able to prevent Antiochus from effecting an entrance. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
the king divided his army into three parts, of which he
entrusted one to Theodotus with orders to close with the
enemy and force their way along the skirts of Libanus; the
second to Menedemus with urgent orders to attempt the centre
of the spur; while the third he put under the command of
Diocles, the military governor of Parapotamia, and ordered
them to keep close to the sea. He himself with his guard
occupied a central position, intending to superintend the
whole action and give help where it was wanted. At the
same time Diognetus and Perigenes made preparations
for a sea-fight, coming as close as possible to the shore,
and endeavouring to make the battles at sea and on land
present the appearance of a single contest. <span class="sidenote">carried by
Antiochus.</span>
A general advance having begun by sea
and land, at the same signal and word of
command, the battle on the sea was undecided, because
the number of vessels on either side and their equipment
were about equal: but on land the troops of Nicolaus got
the best of it at first, from the advantage of their position.
But when Theodotus routed the men on the mountain skirts,
and then charged from the higher ground, Nicolaus&#8217;s men all
turned and fled precipitately. In this flight two thousand of
them fell, and as many were taken prisoners: the rest retreated
towards Sidon. Though he now had the better prospect of
the two in the sea-fight; yet, when he saw the defeat of the
army on land, Perigenes turned his prows and made good his
retreat to the same place.</p>

<p><a name="b5_70" id="b5_70"><b>70.</b></a> Thereupon Antiochus got his army on the march, and,
arriving at Sidon, encamped under its wall. <span class="sidenote">The advance of
Antiochus continued.</span>
He
did not however venture to attempt the town,
because of the vast stores it contained and the
number of its ordinary inhabitants, as well as of the refugees
who had collected there. He therefore broke up his camp
again, and continued his march towards Philoteria: <span class="sidenote">Philoteria.</span>
ordering Diognetus his navarch to sail back
with his ships to Tyre. Now Philoteria is situated right upon
the shores of the lake into which the river Jordan discharges
itself, and from which it issues out again into the plains
surrounding Scythopolis. The surrender of these two cities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
to him encouraged him to prosecute his further designs;
because the country subject to them was easily <span class="sidenote">Scythopolis.</span>
able to supply his whole army with provisions,
and everything necessary for the campaign in abundance.
Having therefore secured them by garrisons, he crossed the
mountain chain and arrived at Atabyrium, <span class="sidenote">Atabyrium.</span>
which
is situated upon a rounded hill, the ascent of
which is more than fifteen stades long. But on this occasion
he managed to take it by an ambuscade and stratagem. He
induced the men of the town to come out to a skirmish, and
enticed their leading columns to a considerable distance; then
his troops suddenly turned from their pretended flight, and
those who were concealed rising from their ambush, he attacked
and killed a large number of the enemy; and finally, by
pursuing close upon their heels, and thus creating a panic in
the town before he reached it, he carried it as he had done
others by assault. <span class="sidenote">Defections from
Ptolemy.</span>
At this juncture Ceraeas, one of Ptolemy&#8217;s
officers, deserted to Antiochus, whose distinguished
reception caused great excitement in
the minds of many other of the enemy&#8217;s officers.
At any rate, not long afterwards, Hippolochus of Thessaly
joined Antiochus with four hundred cavalry of
Ptolemy&#8217;s army. Having therefore secured Atabyrium
also with a garrison, <span class="sidenote">Pella, Camus,
Gephrus.</span>
Antiochus started
once more and took over Pella, Camus, and Gephrus.</p>

<p><a name="b5_71" id="b5_71"><b>71.</b></a> This unbroken stream of success caused the inhabitants
of the neighbouring Arabia to rouse each other up to take action;
and they unanimously joined Antiochus. With the additional
encouragement and supplies which they afforded he continued
his advance; and, arriving in the district of Galatis, made himself
master of Abila, <span class="sidenote">Abila.</span>
and the relieving force which
had thrown itself into that town, under the
command of Nicias, a friend and kinsman of Menneas.
<span class="sidenote">Gadara.</span>
Gadara was the only town now left, which is
thought to be the strongest of any in those parts.
He therefore encamped under its walls and, bringing siege-works
to bear upon it, quickly terrified it into
submission. <span class="sidenote">Rabbatamana.</span>
Then hearing that a strong force
of the enemy were concentrated at Rabbatamana in Arabia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
and were pillaging and overrunning the territory of those
Arabians who had joined him, he threw everything else aside
and started thither; and pitched his camp at the foot of the
high ground on which that city stands. After going round
and reconnoitring the hill, and finding that it admitted of being
ascended only at two points, he led his army to them and set
up his siege artillery at these points. He put one set of siege-works
under the care of Nicarchus, the other under that of
Theodotus: while he superintended both equally, and observed
the zeal shown by the two respectively. Great exertions were
accordingly made by each, and a continual rivalry kept up as
to which should be the first to make a breach in the wall
opposite their works: and the result was that both breaches
were made with unexpected rapidity; whereupon they kept
making assaults night and day, and trying every
means to force an entrance, without an hour&#8217;s
intermission. <span class="sidenote">Fall of Rabbatamana.</span>
But though they kept up these
attempts continuously, they failed to make any impression; until
a prisoner showed them the underground passage through which
the besieged were accustomed to descend to fetch water.
They broke into this and stopped it up with timber and
stones and everything of that sort; and when this was done,
the garrison surrendered for want of water. Having thus got
<span class="sidenote">Samaria.</span>
possession of Rabbatamana, Antiochus left Nicarchus with an
adequate garrison in command of it; and sent the two
deserters from Ptolemy,
<span class="sidenote">Antiochus goes
into winter
quarters,<br /> <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218-217.</span>
Hippolochus and Ceraeas, with five
thousand infantry, to Samaria: with orders to
take the government of the district and protect all
who submitted to him.
He then started with
his army for Ptolemais, where he was resolved
to winter.</p>

<p><a name="b5_72" id="b5_72"><b>72.</b></a> In the course of this same summer, the Pednelissians,
being besieged and reduced to great straits by
the Selgians, <span class="sidenote">Asia Minor,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;218. Relief
of Pednelissus.</span>
sent messages to Achaeus asking<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>
for help: and upon receiving a ready assent,
continued to sustain the siege with great spirit in reliance upon
this hope of relief. Achaeus selected Garsyeris to conduct
the expedition; and sent him out in all haste, with six thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>infantry and five hundred horse, to relieve the Pednelissians.
But when they heard of the approach of the army of relief,
the Selgians occupied the pass called the Stair with the
main body of their own army; and put a garrison at the
entrance into Saperda: breaking up and spoiling all the
paths and tracks leading to it. After entering Milyades and
encamping under the walls of Cretopolis, perceiving that a
farther advance was made impossible by the occupation
of these positions by the enemy, Garsyeris hit upon the
following ruse. He broke up his camp, and began his
return march, as though he had abandoned all thoughts
of relieving Pednelissus, owing to the enemy&#8217;s occupation
of these positions. The Selgians were readily persuaded
that he had really abandoned the relief of Pednelissus, and
departed, some to the besieging camp and others home to
Selge, as it was now close upon harvest-time. Thereupon
Garsyeris faced about, and, marching with great speed, arrived
at the pass over the mountain; and finding it unguarded,
secured it by a garrison, under the command of Phayllus;
while he himself with his main army went to Perga: and thence
sent embassies to the other states in Pisidia and Pamphylia,
pointing out that the power of the Selgians was a standing
menace, and urging all to ally themselves with Achaeus and
join in relieving Pednelissus.</p>

<p><a name="b5_73" id="b5_73"><b>73.</b></a> Meanwhile the Selgians had sent out a general in command
of a force which they hoped would terrify Phallyus by
their superior knowledge of the country, and expel him from his
strong position. But when, far from attaining their object, they
lost large numbers of men in their attacks upon him; though
they abandoned the hope of accomplishing this, they yet
persisted with increased ardour in the siege of Pednelissus.
Garsyeris was now reinforced by eight thousand hoplites from
the Etennes, who inhabit the highlands of Pisidia above Side,
and half that number from Aspendus. The people of Side
itself, partly from a wish to curry favour with Antiochus, but
chiefly from hatred to the Aspendians, refused to take part in
the relief of Pednelissus. With these reinforcements, as well
as his own army, Garsyeris advanced towards Pednelissus,
feeling certain that he would be able to raise the siege at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
first attack: but when the Selgians showed no sign of alarm,
he entrenched himself at a moderate distance from them.
The Pednelissians were now becoming hard pressed from want
of provisions; and Garsyeris, being anxious to do all he could,
got ready two thousand men, giving each a medimnus of
wheat, and despatched them under cover of night into Pednelissus.
But the Selgians getting intelligence of what was going
on, and, coming out to intercept them, most of those who
were carrying in the corn were killed, and the Selgians got
possession of the wheat. Elated with this success, they now
essayed to storm the camp of Garsyeris as well as the city. An
adventurous daring in the presence of the enemy is indeed
characteristic of the Selgians: and on this occasion they left a
barely sufficient number to guard their camp; and, surrounding
the enemy&#8217;s entrenchment with the rest, assaulted it at several
points at once. Finding himself unexpectedly attacked on
every side, and portions of his palisade being already torn down,
Garsyeris, appreciating the gravity of the danger, and feeling
that there was but little chance of averting total destruction,
sent out some cavalry at a point which the enemy had left
unguarded. These the Selgians imagined to be flying in a
panic and for fear of what was coming: and therefore, instead
of attending to them, they treated them with utter contempt.
When these horsemen, however, had ridden round, so as to
get on the rear of the enemy, they charged and fought with
great fierceness. This raised the spirits of Garsyeris&#8217;s infantry,
though they had already given way: and they therefore faced
round, and once more offered resistance to the troops that were
storming their camp. The Selgians, accordingly, being now
attacked on front and rear at once, broke and fled. At the
same time the Pednelissians sallied out and attacked the
troops left in charge of the Selgian camp, and drove them out.
The pursuit lasted to so great a distance that no less than
ten thousand of the Selgian army fell: of the survivors all
who were allies fled to their own cities; while the Selgians
themselves escaped over the highlands into their native land.</p>

<p><a name="b5_74" id="b5_74"><b>74.</b></a> Garsyeris immediately started in pursuit of the
fugitives, being in haste to get over the narrow pass, and
approach Selge, before they could make a stand, and form any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
plan for meeting his approach. <span class="sidenote">Panic at Selge.</span>
Thus he came to Selge with
his army. But the inhabitants, having no longer
any hopes in their allies, after the disaster which
had affected them all alike, and themselves dispirited at the
misfortune which had befallen them, became exceedingly
anxious for the safety of themselves and their country. They
accordingly determined in public assembly to send one of their
citizens on an embassy to Garsyeris, and selected for the
purpose Logbasis, who had been for a long time on terms of
intimacy and friendship with the Antiochus that lost his life
in Thrace.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Laodice,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> also, who became afterwards the wife of
Achaeus, having been committed to his care, he had brought
this young lady up as his daughter, and had treated her with
conspicuous kindness. <span class="sidenote">Logbasis turns
traitor.</span>
The Selgians therefore
thought that his character made him eminently
fitted for an ambassador in the circumstances, and
accordingly sent him on the mission. He, however, obtained a
private interview with Garsyeris, and was so far from carrying
out the purpose for which he came, by properly supporting the
interests of his country, that on the contrary he strongly urged
Garsyeris to send with all speed for Achaeus, and undertook
to put the city into their hands. Garsyeris, of course, grasped
eagerly at the chance offered to him and sent messengers to induce
Achaeus to come, and to inform him of the position of
affairs. Meanwhile he concluded an armistice with the Selgians,
and protracted the negotiations for a treaty by continually bringing
forward objections and scruples on points of detail, in order
to give time for the arrival of Achaeus, and for Logbasis to
conduct his negotiations and mature his plot.</p>

<p><a name="b5_75" id="b5_75"><b>75.</b></a> While this was going on frequent meetings for discussion
took place between the camp and the town, and it
became quite an ordinary thing for the soldiers to go into the
town to purchase corn. This is a state of things which has
on many occasions proved fatal. And it appears to me that
of all animals the most easily deceived is man, though he has
the credit of being the most cunning. For consider how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>many entrenched camps and fortresses, how many and what
great cities have been betrayed by this kind of trick! And yet
in spite of such frequent and conspicuous examples of the many
people to whom it has happened, somehow or another we are
always new to such deceit, and fall into the trap with the inexperience
of youth. The reason is that we do not keep ready
for reference in our minds the disasters of those who have made
mistakes before us in this or that particular. But while preparing
with great labour and cost stores of corn and money, and a
provision of walls and weapons to meet unforeseen eventualities,
that which is the easiest of all and the most serviceable in the
hour of danger&mdash;that we all neglect; although we might obtain
this experience from history and research, which in themselves
add a dignity to leisure and a charm to existence.</p>

<p>Achaeus then duly arrived at the time expected: and after
conference with him, the Selgians had great <span class="sidenote">Failure of the
treason of
Logbasis.</span>
hopes of experiencing some signal kindness at
his hands. But in the interval Logbasis had
little by little collected in his house some of the soldiers who
came into the town from the camp; and now advised the
citizens not to let slip the opportunity, but to act with the
display of Achaeus&#8217;s kindly disposition towards them before their
eyes; and to put the finishing stroke to the treaty, after holding
a general assembly of the whole community to discuss the
situation. An assembly was at once convened, to which even
those on guard were all summoned to assist in bringing the
treaty to completion; and the citizens began deliberating on
the state of affairs.</p>

<p><a name="b5_76" id="b5_76"><b>76.</b></a> Meanwhile Logbasis, who had agreed with the enemy
to take that opportunity, began getting ready those who had
congregated at his house, and prepared and armed himself
and his sons also for the fight. And now Achaeus with half
the hostile force was advancing towards the city itself; while
Garsyeris with the remainder was marching towards the
Cesbedium as it is called, or temple of Zeus, which stands
in a position commanding the city and presenting very much
the appearance of a citadel. But a goatherd, having by
chance observed what was going on, brought the news to the
assembly; thereupon some of the citizens made a hurried rush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
to the Cesbedium, others to their posts on the wall, and
the majority in great anger to the house of Logbasis. His
treasonable practice being thus detected, some of them climbed
upon the roof, others forced their way in by the front door, and
murdered Logbasis and his sons and all the other men which
they found there at the same time. Then they caused a proclamation
to be made promising freedom to all slaves who
would join them: and dividing themselves into three companies,
they hastened to defend all the points of vantage.
When he saw that the Cesbedium was already occupied,
Garsyeris abandoned his enterprise; but Achaeus held on his
way until he came right up to the gates: whereupon the
Selgians sallied out, killed seven hundred, and forced the rest
to give up the attempt. Upon this conclusion of their enterprise,
Achaeus and Garsyeris retired to the camp. But the
Selgians fearing treason among themselves, and alarmed at the
presence of a hostile camp, sent out some of their elders in the
guise of suppliants, and concluded a peace, on condition of
paying four hundred talents on the spot and restoring the
Pednelissians whom they had taken prisoners, and paying a
further sum of three hundred talents at a fixed date. Thus
did the Selgians by their own valour save their country, which
they had been in danger of losing through the infamous
treason of Logbasis; and thus neither disgraced their freedom,
nor their relationship to the Lacedaemonians.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p><a name="b5_77" id="b5_77"><b>77.</b></a> But after reducing Milyas, and the greater part of
Pamphylia, Achaeus took his departure, and arriving at Sardis
kept up a continuous warfare with Attalus, and began threatening
Prusias, and making himself an object of terror and
alarm to all the inhabitants on this side Taurus.</p>

<p>But while Achaeus was engaged on his expedition against
Selge, Attalus with the Aegosagae from Gaul was
going through all the cities in Aeolis, <span class="sidenote">The expedition of
Attalus to
recover cities
which had joined
Achaeus.</span>
and the
neighbourhood, which had before this been
terrified into joining Achaeus; but most of which
now voluntarily and even gratefully gave in
their adherence to him, though there were some few which
waited to be forced. Now the cities which transferred their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>allegiance to him in the first instance were Cyme, Smyrna, and
Phocaea; after them Aegae and Temnus submitted, in terror at
his approach; and thereupon he was waited upon by ambassadors
from Teos and Colophon with offers to surrender themselves
and their cities. He received them also upon the same terms
as they had enjoyed before, taking hostages; but he treated the
ambassadors from Smyrna with special kindness, because they
had been the most constant in their loyalty of all. Continuing
his march without interruption, he crossed the Lycus
and arrived at the hamlets of Mysia, and thence came to
Carseae. Overawing the inhabitants of this town, as well as
the garrison of the Two Walls, he got them surrendered to him
by Themistocles, who had been, as it happened, left by Achaeus
in command of this district. Starting thence, and wasting the
plain of Apia, he crossed Mount Pelecas and encamped near
the river Megistus.</p>

<p><a name="b5_78" id="b5_78"><b>78.</b></a> While he was here an eclipse of the moon occurred:
and the Gauls who had all along been <span class="sidenote">Mutiny of the
Gauls.</span>
much discontented at the hardships of the
march,&mdash;which was rendered the more painful
for them by the fact of their being accompanied by their
wives and children, who followed the host in waggons,&mdash;now
regarded the eclipse as an evil augury, and refused to go
on. But King Attalus, who got no effective service out of
them, and saw that they straggled during the march and
encamped by themselves, and wholly declined to obey orders
and despised all authority, was in great doubt as to what to
do. He was anxious less they should desert to Achaeus, and
join in an attack upon himself: and was at the same time uneasy
at the scandal to which he would give rise, if he caused his
soldiers to surround and kill all these men, who were believed
to have crossed into Asia in reliance on his honour. He
therefore seized the occasion of their refusal to proceed, to
promise them that he would see that they were taken back to
the place where they had crossed into Asia; would assign them
suitable lands for a settlement; and would afterwards do them
any service they asked for, if it was within his power and
consistent with justice.</p>

<p>Accordingly Attalus led the Aegosagae back to the Hellespont;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
and after negotiations with the people of Lampsacus,
Ilium, and Alexandria, conducted in a friendly spirit because
they had preserved their loyalty to him, he returned with his
army to Pergamum.</p>

<p><a name="b5_79" id="b5_79"><b>79.</b></a> At the beginning of the following spring, having all
preparations for war completed, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.
Antiochus and

hostilities

70,000 infantry,

Antiochus and
Ptolemy determined to bring their claims to
Coele-Syria to the decision of a battle. Ptolemy
accordingly set out from Alexandria with seventy
thousand infantry, five thousand cavalry, and
seventy three elephants. Being informed of his
approach, Antiochus drew his forces together.
These consisted of Daae, Carmani, and Cilicians,
equipped as light armed troops to the number of about
five thousand, under the charge and command
of Byttacus the Macedonian.
Under Theodotus, the
Aetolian, who had deserted from
Ptolemy, were ten thousand picked men from
the whole kingdom, armed in the Macedonian
fashion, most of whom had silver shields. The number of
<span class="sidenote">The army of
Antiochus:
62,000 infantry,
6000 cavalry,
102 elephants.</span>the phalanx was twenty thousand, and they were led by
Nicarchus and Theodotus Hemiolius. In addition to these
there were Agrianes and Persians, who were either bowmen
or slingers, to the number of two thousand. With them
were a thousand Thracians, under the command of Menedemus
of Alabanda. There was also a mixed force of Medes,
Cissians, Cadusians, and Carmanians, amounting to five
thousand men, who were assigned to the chief command of
Aspasianus the Mede. Certain Arabians also and men of
neighbouring tribes, to the number of ten thousand, were
commanded by Zabdibelus. The mercenaries from Greece
amounting to five thousand were led by Hippolochus of
Thessaly. Antiochus had also fifteen hundred Cretans who
came with Eurylochus, and a thousand Neo-Cretans commanded
by Zelys of Gortyna; with whom were five hundred
javelin men of Lydia, and a thousand Cardaces who came with
Lysimachus the Gaul. The entire number of his horse was
six thousand; four thousand were commanded by the king&#8217;s
nephew Antipater, the rest by Themison; so that the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
number of Antiochus&#8217;s force was sixty-two thousand infantry,
six thousand cavalry, and one hundred and two elephants.</p>

<p><a name="b5_80" id="b5_80"><b>80.</b></a> Having marched to Pelusium Ptolemy made his first
halt in that town: and having been there
joined by the stragglers, <span class="sidenote">Ptolemy enters
Palestine.</span>
and having given
out their rations of corn to his men, he
got the army in motion, and led them by a line of march
which goes through the waterless region skirting Mount
Casius and the Marshes.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> On the fifth day&#8217;s march he
reached his destination, and pitched his camp a distance of
fifty stades from Rhaphia, which is the first city of Coele-Syria
towards Egypt.</p>

<p>While Ptolemy was effecting this movement Antiochus
arrived with his army at Gaza, where he
was joined by some reinforcements, <span class="sidenote">Antiochus goes
to meet him.</span>
and
once more commenced his advance, proceeding
at a leisurely pace. He passed Rhaphia and encamped
about ten stades from the enemy. For a while the
two armies preserved this distance, and remained encamped
opposite each other. But after some few days, wishing to
remove to more advantageous ground and to inspire confidence
in his troops, Antiochus pushed forward his camp so much
nearer Ptolemy, that the palisades of the two camps were not
more than five stades from each other; and while in this
position, there were frequent struggles at the watering-places
and on forays, as well as infantry and cavalry skirmishes in
the space between the camps.</p>

<p><a name="b5_81" id="b5_81"><b>81.</b></a> In the course of these proceedings Theodotus conceived
and put into execution an enterprise, very
characteristic of an Aetolian, <span class="sidenote">Daring attempt of
Theodotus to assassinate
Ptolemy.</span>
but undoubtedly
requiring great personal courage. Having
formerly lived at Ptolemy&#8217;s court he knew the king&#8217;s tastes and
habits. Accordingly, accompanied by two others, he entered
the enemy&#8217;s camp just before daybreak; where, owing to the
dim light, he could not be recognised by his face, while his
dress and other accoutrements did not render him noticeable,
owing to the variety of costume prevailing among themselves.
He had marked the position of the king&#8217;s tent during the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>preceding days, for the skirmishes took place quite close; and
he now walked boldly up to it, and passed through all the outer
ring of attendants without being observed: but when he came
to the tent in which the king was accustomed to transact
business and dine, though he searched it in every conceivable
way, he failed to find the king; for Ptolemy slept in another
tent, separate from the public and official tent. He however
wounded two men who were sleeping there, and killed
Andreas, the king&#8217;s physician; and then returned safely to his
own camp, without meeting with any molestation, except just as
he was passing over the vallum of the enemy&#8217;s camp. As far
as daring went, he had fulfilled his purpose: but he had failed
in prudence by not taking the precaution to ascertain where
Ptolemy was accustomed to sleep.</p>

<p><a name="b5_82" id="b5_82"><b>82.</b></a> After being encamped opposite each other for five
days, the two kings resolved to bring matters
to the decision of battle. <span class="sidenote">Disposition of the
two armies for
the battle of
Rhaphia.</span>
And upon
Ptolemy beginning to move his army outside
its camp, Antiochus hastened to do the
same. Both formed their front of their phalanx and men
armed in the Macedonian manner. But Ptolemy&#8217;s two
wings were formed as follows:&mdash;Polycrates, with the cavalry
under his command, occupied the left, and between him and
the phalanx were Cretans standing close by the horsemen;
next them came the royal guard;<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> then the peltasts under
Socrates, adjoining the Libyans armed in Macedonian fashion.
On the right wing was Echecrates of Thessaly, with his division
of cavalry; on his left were stationed Gauls and Thracians;
next them Phoxidas and the Greek mercenaries, extending to
the Egyptian phalanx. Of the elephants forty were on the left
wing, where Ptolemy was to be in person during the battle;
the other thirty-three had been stationed in front of the right
wing opposite the mercenary cavalry.</p>

<p>Antiochus also placed sixty of his elephants commanded
by his foster-brother Philip in front of his right wing, on which
he was to be present personally, to fight opposite Ptolemy.
Behind these he stationed the two thousand cavalry commanded
by Antipater, and two thousand more at right angles to them.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span></p>
<p>In line with the cavalry he placed the Cretans, and next
them the Greek mercenaries; with the latter he mixed two
thousand of these armed in the Macedonian fashion under
the command of the Macedonian Byttacus. At the extreme
point of the left wing he placed two thousand cavalry under
the command of Themison; by their side Cardacian and
Lydian javelin-men; next them the light-armed division of
three thousand, commanded by Menedemus; then the Cissians,
Medes, and Carmanians; and by their side the Arabians and
neighbouring peoples who continued the line up to the phalanx.
The remainder of the elephants he placed in front of his left
wing under the command of Myiscus, one of the boys about
the court.</p>

<p><a name="b5_83" id="b5_83"><b>83.</b></a> The two armies having been drawn up in the order I
have described; the kings went along their
respective lines, <span class="sidenote">Addresses to the
two armies before
the battle of
Rhaphia.</span>
and addressed words of encouragement
and exhortation to their officers
and friends. But as they both rested their
strongest hopes on their phalanx, they showed their greatest
earnestness and addressed their strongest exhortations to them;
which were re-echoed in Ptolemy&#8217;s case by Andromachus and
Sosibius and the king&#8217;s sister Arsinoe; in the case of Antiochus
by Theodotus and Nicarchus: these officers being the commanders
of the phalanx in the two armies respectively. The
substance of what was said on both sides was the same: for
neither monarch had any glorious or famous achievement of
his own to quote to those whom he was addressing, seeing that
they had but recently succeeded to their crowns; but they
endeavoured to inspire the men of the phalanx with spirit
and boldness, by reminding them of the glory of their ancestors,
and the great deeds performed by them. But they chiefly
dwelt upon the hopes of advancement which the men might
expect at their hands in the future; and they called upon and
exhorted the leaders and the whole body of men, who were
about to be engaged, to maintain the fight with a manly and
courageous spirit. So with these or similar words, delivered
by their own lips or by interpreters, they rode along their
lines.</p>

<p><a name="b5_84" id="b5_84"><b>84.</b></a> Ptolemy, accompanied by his sister, having arrived at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
the left wing of his army, and Antiochus with the royal guard
at the right: they gave the signal for the battle, <span class="sidenote">The battle of
Rhaphia.</span>
and opened the fight by a charge of elephants.
Only some few of Ptolemy&#8217;s elephants
came to close quarters with the foe: seated on these the
soldiers in the howdahs maintained a brilliant fight, lunging at
and striking each other with crossed pikes.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> But the elephants
themselves fought still more brilliantly, using all their strength
in the encounter, and pushing against each other, forehead to
forehead.</p>

<p>The way in which elephants fight is this: they get their
tusks entangled and jammed, <span class="sidenote">Fighting elephants.</span>
and then push
against one another with all their might, trying
to make each other yield ground until one of
them proving superior in strength has pushed aside the other&#8217;s
trunk; and when once he can get a side blow at his enemy,
he pierces him with his tusks as a bull would with his horns.
Now, most of Ptolemy&#8217;s animals, as is the way with Libyan
elephants, were afraid to face the fight: for they cannot stand
the smell or the trumpeting of the Indian elephants, but are
frightened at their size and strength, I suppose, and run away
from them at once without waiting to come near them. <span class="sidenote">Antiochus&#8217;s right
wing successful.</span>
This
is exactly what happened on this occasion: and upon their
being thrown into confusion and being driven
back upon their own lines, Ptolemy&#8217;s guard
gave way before the rush of the animals; while
Antiochus, wheeling his men so as to avoid the elephants,
charged the division of cavalry under Polycrates. At the
same time the Greek mercenaries stationed near the phalanx,
and behind the elephants, charged Ptolemy&#8217;s peltasts and made
them give ground, the elephants having already thrown their
ranks also into confusion. Thus Ptolemy&#8217;s whole left wing
began to give way before the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b5_85" id="b5_85"><b>85.</b></a> Echecrates the commander of the right wing waited at
first to see the result of the struggle between <span class="sidenote">Ptolemy&#8217;s right
wing also
successful.</span>
the other wings of the two armies: but when he
saw the dust coming his way, and that the
elephants opposite his division were afraid even to approach
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>the hostile elephants at all, he ordered Phoxidas to charge the
part of the enemy opposite him with his Greek mercenaries;
while he made a flank movement with the cavalry and the
division behind the elephants; and so getting out of the line of
the hostile elephants&#8217; attack, charged the enemy&#8217;s cavalry on
the rear or the flank and quickly drove them from their
ground. Phoxidas and his men were similarly successful: for
they charged the Arabians and Medes and forced them into
precipitate flight. Thus Antiochus&#8217;s right wing gained a victory,
while his left was defeated. <span class="sidenote">The centre
coming into
action. Ptolemy
is victorious.</span>
The phalanxes, left
without the support of either wing, remained
intact in the centre of the plain, in a state of
alternate hope and fear for the result. Meanwhile
Antiochus was assisting in gaining the victory on his right
wing; while Ptolemy, who had retired behind his phalanx,
now came forward in the centre, and showing himself in the
view of both armies struck terror in the hearts of the enemy,
but inspired great spirit and enthusiasm in his own men;
and Andromachus and Sosibius at once ordered them to lower
their sarissae and charge. The picked Syrian troops stood
their ground only for a short time, and the division of Nicarchus
quickly broke and fled. Antiochus presuming, in his youthful
inexperience, from the success of his own division, that he
would be equally victorious all along the line, was pressing on
the pursuit; but upon one of the older officers at length
giving him warning, and pointing out that the cloud of dust
raised by the phalanx was moving towards their own camp, he
understood too late what was happening; and endeavoured to
gallop back with the squadron of royal cavalry on to the field.
<span class="sidenote">Final retreat of
Antiochus.</span>
But finding his whole line in full retreat he was
forced to retire to Rhaphia: comforting himself
with the belief that, as far as he was personally
concerned, he had won a victory, but had been defeated in
the whole battle by the want of spirit and courage shown by
the rest.</p>

<p><a name="b5_86" id="b5_86"><b>86.</b></a> Having secured the final victory by his phalanx, and
killed large numbers of the enemy in the pursuit by means of
his cavalry and mercenaries on his right wing, Ptolemy retired
to his own camp and there spent the night. But next day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
after picking up and burying his own dead, and stripping the
bodies of the enemy, he advanced towards Rhaphia. Antiochus
had wished, immediately after the retreat of his army, to make
a camp outside the city; and there rally such of his men as had
fled in compact bodies: but finding that the greater number
had retreated into the town, he was compelled to enter it himself
also. Next morning, however, before daybreak, he led out
the relics of his army and made the best of his way to Gaza.
There he pitched a camp: and having sent an embassy to
obtain leave to pick up his dead, he obtained a truce for
performing their obsequies. <span class="sidenote">The losses on
either side.</span>
His loss amounted
to nearly ten thousand infantry and three
hundred cavalry killed, and four thousand taken
prisoners. Three elephants were killed on the field, and two
died afterwards of their wounds. On Ptolemy&#8217;s side the
losses were fifteen hundred infantry killed and seven hundred
cavalry: sixteen of his elephants were killed, and most of the
others captured.</p>

<p>Such was the result of the battle of Rhaphia between kings
Ptolemy and Antiochus for the possession of Coele-Syria.</p>

<p>After picking up his dead Antiochus retired with his army
to his own country: while Ptolemy took over
Rhaphia and the other towns without difficulty, <span class="sidenote">The effect of the
battle of Rhaphia.</span>
all the states vying with each other as to
which should be first to renew their allegiance and come over
to him. And perhaps it is the way of the world everywhere
to accommodate one&#8217;s self to circumstances at such times; but
it is eminently true of the race inhabiting that country, that they
have a natural turn and inclination to worship success. Moreover
it was all the more natural in this case, owing to the
existing disposition of the people in favour of the Alexandrian
kings; for the inhabitants of Coele-Syria are somehow always
more loyally disposed to this family than to any other. Accordingly
they now stopped short of no extravagance of adulation,
honouring Ptolemy with crowns, sacrifices, and every possible
compliment of the kind.</p>

<p><a name="b5_87" id="b5_87"><b>87.</b></a> Meanwhile Antiochus, on arriving at the city which
bears his own name, immediately despatched an embassy to
Ptolemy, consisting of Antipater, his nephew, and Theodotus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Hemiolius, to treat of a peace, in great alarm lest the enemy
should advance upon him. For his defeat had
inspired him with distrust of his own forces, <span class="sidenote">Peace between
Ptolemy and
Antiochus for a
year, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>
and he was afraid that Achaeus would seize
the opportunity to attack him. It did not
occur to Ptolemy to take any of these circumstances into
account: but being thoroughly satisfied with his unexpected
success, and generally at his unlooked for acquisition of Coele-Syria,
he was by no means indisposed to peace; but even more
inclined to it than he ought to have been: influenced in that
direction by the habitual effeminacy and corruption of his
manner of life. Accordingly, when Antipater and his colleague
arrived, after some little bluster and vituperation of Antiochus
for what had taken place, he agreed to a truce for a year. He
sent Sosibius back with the ambassadors to ratify the treaty:
while he himself, after remaining three months in Syria and
Phoenicia, and settling the towns, left Andromachus of
Aspendus as governor of this district, and started with his
sister and friends for Alexandria: having brought the war to a
conclusion in a way that surprised his subjects, when they
contrasted it with the principles on which he spent the rest of
his life. Antiochus after exchanging ratifications of the treaty
with Sosibius, employed himself in making preparations for
attacking Achaeus, as he had originally begun doing. Such
was the political situation in Asia.</p>

<p><a name="b5_88" id="b5_88"><b>88.</b></a> About the same period the earthquake occurred at
Rhodes, which overthrew the great Colossus and
the larger part of the walls and dockyards. <span class="sidenote">Earthquake at
Rhodes. Royal
liberality,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;224.</span>
But
the adroit policy of the Rhodians converted this
misfortune into an opportunity; and under their
skilful management, instead of adding to their embarrassments,
it became the means of restoring their prosperity. So decisive
in human affairs, public or private, is the difference between incapacity
and good sense, between idle indifference and a close
attention to business. Good fortune only damages the one,
while disaster is but a means of recovery to the other. This
was illustrated by the manner in which the Rhodians turned
the misfortune that befel them to account. They enhanced its
magnitude and importance by the prominence which they gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
it, and the serious tone in which they spoke of it, as well
by the mouth of their ambassadors as in the intercourse
of private life; and they created thus such an effect upon
other states, and especially upon the feelings of the
kings, that they were not only overwhelmed with presents,
but made the donors feel actually obliged for their acceptance
of them. Hiero and Gelo, for instance, <span class="sidenote">Hiero and Gelo.</span>
presented them with seventy-five talents of
silver, part at once, and the rest at a very short interval, as a
contribution towards the expenses of the gymnasium; gave
them for religious purposes some silver cauldrons and their
stands, and some water vessels; and in addition to this
ten talents for their sacrifices, and ten more to attract
new citizens: their intention being that the whole present
should amount to a hundred talents.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Not only so, but
they gave immunity from customs to Rhodian merchants
coming to their ports; and presented them besides with fifty
catapults of three cubits length. In spite too of these large
gifts, they regarded themselves as under an obligation to the
Rhodians; and accordingly erected statues in the <i>Deigma</i> or
Mart of Rhodes, representing the community of Rhodes
crowned by that of Syracuse.</p>

<p><a name="b5_89" id="b5_89"><b>89.</b></a> Then too Ptolemy offered them three hundred talents
of silver; a million medimni<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> of corn; <span class="sidenote">Ptolemy.</span>
ship
timber for ten quinqueremes and ten triremes,
consisting of forty thousand cubits of squared pine planking;
a thousand talents of bronze coinage; three thousand
talents<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> of tow; three thousand pieces of sail cloth; three
thousand talents for the repair of the Colossus; a hundred
master builders with three hundred and fifty workmen,
and fourteen talents yearly to pay their wages.
Besides this he gave twelve thousand medimni of corn for
their public games and sacrifices, and twenty thousand medimni
for victualling ten triremes. The greater part of these goods
was delivered at once, as well as a third of the whole of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
money named. In a similar spirit Antigonus offered ten
thousand timbers, varying from sixteen to eight cubits in
length, to be used as purlins; <span class="sidenote">Antigonus.</span>
five thousand
rafters seven cubits long; three thousand
talents of iron; a thousand talents of pitch; a thousand
amphorae of the same unboiled; and a hundred talents
of silver besides. His queen, Chryseis, also gave a hundred
thousand medimni of corn, and three thousand talents of
lead. Again Seleucus,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> father of Antiochus, besides granting
freedom from imports to Rhodians sailing to his dominions,
and besides giving ten quinqueremes fully equipped, and two
hundred thousand medimni of corn; gave also ten thousand
cubits of timber, and a thousand talents of resin and hair.</p>

<p><a name="b5_90" id="b5_90"><b>90.</b></a> Nor were Prusias and Mithridates far behind these in
liberality; nor the princes Lysanias, Olympichus,
and Lymnaeas, <span class="sidenote">Other princes.</span>
who were at that time in power
in different parts of Asia; and as for states that, according to
their several abilities contributed to their assistance, it would be
difficult to reckon their number. In fact, though when we
regard the time which it took the city to recover its populousness,
and the state of desolation from which it started, we
cannot fail to be struck at the rapidity and the extent of its
improvement in regard both to private and public wealth; yet
when we contemplate the natural advantages of its site, and
the contributions from outside which served to raise its
fortunes to their original height, this feeling must give way to
a conviction that the advance was somewhat less than might
have been expected.</p>

<p>My object in giving these details is twofold. I wished to
exhibit the brilliant conduct of their public affairs by the
Rhodians, for indeed they deserve both to be commended and
imitated: and I wished also to point out the insignificance of
the gifts bestowed by the kings of our own day, and received
by nations and states; that these monarchs may not imagine
that by the expenditure of four or five talents they are doing
anything so very great, or expect to receive at the hands of the
Greeks the honour enjoyed by former kings; and that states
when they see before their eyes the magnitude of the presents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>formerly bestowed, may not, nowadays, in return for insignificant
and paltry benefactions, blindly bestow their most ample
and splendid honours; but may use that discrimination in
apportioning their favours to desert, in which Greeks excel the
rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="b5_91" id="b5_91"><b>91.</b></a> Just at the beginning of this summer, while Agetas
was Strategus of the Aetolians, and when Aratus
had just become Strategus of <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217. Greece.
Return of Lycurgus
to Sparta.
He projects an

Messenia.</span>
the Achaean
league,&mdash;at which point we broke off in our
history of the Social war,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a>&mdash;Lycurgus of Sparta
returned home from Aetolia. The Ephors had
discovered that the charge on which he had
been banished was false; and had accordingly sent for him
back, and recalled him from exile. He at once began making
an arrangement with Pyrrhias the Aetolian, who happened at
the time to be commander in Elis, for an invasion of Messenia.
<span class="sidenote">The preparations
of Aratus.</span>
Now, when Aratus came into office, he found the
mercenary army of the league in a state of
complete demoralisation, and the cities very
slack to pay the tax for their support, owing to the bad and
spiritless manner in which his predecessor Eperatus had
managed the affairs of the league. He, however, exhorted
the members of the league to reform, and obtained a decree
dealing with this matter; and then threw himself with energy
into the preparations for the war. The decree passed by
the Achaeans ordered the maintenance of eight thousand
mercenary infantry and five hundred horse, together with three
thousand Achaean infantry and three hundred horse, enrolled
in the usual way; and that of these latter five hundred foot and
fifty horse were to be brazen-shield men from Megalopolis,
and the same number of Argives. It ordered also that
three ships should be manned to cruise off Acte and in the
Argolic gulf, and three off Patrae and Dyme, and in the sea
there.</p>

<p><a name="b5_92" id="b5_92"><b>92.</b></a> While Aratus was engaged in these transactions, and
in completing these preparations, Lycurgus and Pyrrhias, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
an interchange of messages to secure their making their
expedition at the same time, marched into Messenia.
The Achaean Strategus, aware of their
design, <span class="sidenote">The ill-success of
Lycurgus.</span>
came with the mercenaries and some of
the picked Achaeans to Megalopolis, with the view of supporting
the Messenians. After setting out, Lycurgus got possession of
Calamae, a stronghold in Messenia, by treachery; and pressed
hurriedly forward to effect a junction with the Aetolians. But
Pyrrhias had started from Elis with a wholly inadequate force,
and, having been easily stopped at the pass into Messenia by the
Cyparissians, had turned back. Lycurgus therefore being
unable to effect his junction with Pyrrhias, and not being
strong enough by himself, after assaulting Andania for a
short time, returned back to Sparta without having effected
anything.</p>

<p>When the plot of the enemy had thus gone to pieces;
Aratus, with a provident regard for the future, arranged with
Taurion to provide fifty horse and five hundred foot, and with
the Messenians to send an equal number; with the view of
using these men to protect the territories of Messenia, Megalopolis,
Tegea, and Argos,&mdash;for these districts, being on the
frontier of Laconia, have to bear the brunt of Lacedaemonian
invasion for the rest of the Peloponnese; while with the
Achaean levies and mercenaries he planned to guard the parts
of Achaia which lay towards Elis and Aetolia.</p>

<p><a name="b5_93" id="b5_93"><b>93.</b></a> After adjusting these matters, he settled in accordance
with the decree of the league the
intestine disputes at Megalopolis. <span class="sidenote">Condition of
Megalopolis.</span>
For it
happened that the people of this town having
been recently deprived of their country by Cleomenes,<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> and, to
use a common expression, shaken to their foundations, were
in absolute want of many things, and ill-provided with all:
for they persisted in maintaining their usual scale of living,
while their means both public and private were entirely
crippled. The consequence was that the town was filled with
disputes, jealousies, and mutual hatred; which is ever the
case, both with states and individuals, when means fall short of
desires. The first controversy was about the walling of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>town,&mdash;one party maintaining that the limits of the city should
be contracted to a size admitting of being completely walled
and guarded at a time of danger; for that in the late occasion
it was its size and unguarded state which had caused their
disaster. In addition to this it was maintained by this party
that the landowners should contribute the third part of their
land to provide for the enrolment of new citizens. The other
party rejected the notion of contracting the limits of the city
and would not consent to contribute a third part of their lands.
But the most serious controversy of all was in regard to the
laws draughted for them by Prytanis, an eminent Peripatetic
philosopher, whom Antigonus Doson appointed to draw them
up a constitution. In this distracted state of politics, Aratus
intervened with all the earnestness he could command, and
succeeded in pacifying the heated feelings of the citizens. The
terms on which the controversies were settled were engraved on
a column, and set up near the altar of Vesta in the Homarium.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<p><a name="b5_94" id="b5_94"><b>94.</b></a> After arranging this settlement, Aratus broke up his
camp; and going on himself to the congress
from of the Achaeans, <span class="sidenote">Another raid of
Aetolians from
Elis.</span>handed over the mercenaries
to Lycus of Pharae, as the Sub-Strategus
of the league. But the Eleans, being dissatisfied with
Pyrrhias, once more induced the Aetolians to send them
Euripidas; who, waiting until the Achaeans were engaged in
their congress, took sixty horse and two thousand foot, and
started on a raid. Having passed through the territory of
Pharae, he overran the country up to the territory of Aegium;
and after securing and driving off a considerable booty, he
began a retreat towards Leontium. But Lycus, learning what
had happened, went in all haste to protect the country; and
falling in with the enemy, he attacked them at once and killed
four hundred and took two hundred prisoners, among whom
were the following men of rank: Physsias, Antanor, Clearchus,
Androlochus, Euanoridas, Aristogeiton, Nicasippus, and
Aspasius. <span class="sidenote">The Achaean
fleet retaliates on
Aetolia.</span>
The arms and baggage fell entirely
into his hands. About the same time the
Navarch of the league having gone on an
expedition to Molycria, returned with nearly a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>captives. Returning once more to Aetolia he sailed to
Chalceia and captured two war ships, with their crews, which
put out to resist him; and took also a long boat with its men
on the Aetolian Rhium. There being thus an influx of booty
both by sea and land at the same period, and a considerable
amount of money and provisions being obtained from this, the
soldiers felt confident of getting their pay, and the cities of the
league were sanguine of not being likely to be hard pressed by
their contributions.</p>

<p><a name="b5_95" id="b5_95"><b>95.</b></a> While these events were taking place Scerdilaidas,
thinking that he was not being treated fairly, <span class="sidenote">Scerdilaidas the
Illyrian plunders
the coast.</span>
because some of the payments agreed upon
in his treaty with Philip were in arrear, sent
out fifteen galleys, treacherously pretending that their object
was to receive and convoy the money. These galleys
sailed to Leucas, where they were received by all as friendly,
owing to their former alliance: but the only mischief they
had time to do was to make a treacherous attack on the
Corinthian Agathinus and Cassander, who had come there on
board Taurion&#8217;s ships, and were lying at anchor close to them
with four vessels. These they captured with their vessels and
sent to Scerdilaidas; and then putting out to sea from Leucas,
and sailing towards Malea, they plundered and captured the
merchants whom they met.</p>

<p>Harvest time was now approaching: and as Taurion paid
little attention to the protection of the cities
I mentioned above; <span class="sidenote">More raids.</span>
Aratus in person, at the
head of some picked Achaean troops, protected the getting
in of the harvest round Argos: while Euripidas at the head
of a force of Aetolians set out on a raid, with the object
of ravaging the territory of Tritaea. But when Lycus and
Demodocus, the Hipparch of the league, heard of the expedition
of the Aetolians from Elis, they collected the people of
Dymae, Patrae and Pharae, and joining the mercenaries to
these forces made an incursion upon Elis. Arrived at a place
called Phyxium, they allowed their light-armed troops and
their horse to plunder the country, but kept their hoplites
concealed near this place: and when the Eleans had sallied
out in full force to attack the foraging parties, and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
pursuing them as they retreated, the hoplites with Lycus rose
from their hiding-place and charged them as they rushed
heedlessly on. The Eleans did not stand against the attack,
but fled at the mere appearance of the hoplites: who killed two
hundred of them and took eighty prisoners, and carried off
with them in safety all the booty that had been driven in from
the country. At the same time the Navarch of the league
made numerous descents upon Calydonia and the territory of
Naupactus; and not only overran the country, but twice
annihilated the force sent out to resist him. Among others he
took Cleonicus of Naupactus prisoner: who owing to this being
a proxenus of the Achaeans was not sold on the spot, and after
some little time was set free without ransom.</p>

<p><a name="b5_96" id="b5_96"><b>96.</b></a> About the same time Agetas, the Strategus of the
Aetolian league, proclaimed a general levy of
Aetolians, <span class="sidenote">Acarnania.</span>
and went on a foraging expedition into
the territory of the Acarnanians. He marched through all
Epirus, plundering as he went without let or hindrance;
after doing which he returned home, and dismissed the Aetolian
levy to their own cities. But the Acarnanians, upon making a
retaliatory invasion of the territory of Stratus, were seized with a
panic: and returned with disgrace, though without loss; because
the people of Stratus did not venture to pursue them, believing
that their retreat was a ruse to cover an ambuscade.</p>

<p>An instance of counter-treachery occurred also at Phanoteus.
Alexander who had been appointed governor of
Phocis by Philip, <span class="sidenote">Phanoteus in
Phocis. The biter
bit.</span>
entered into a plot against
the Aetolians, through the agency of a certain
Jason, who had been appointed by himself to command the
city of Phanoteus. This man sent a message to Agetas, the
Strategus of the Aetolian league, agreeing to hand over to him
the citadel of Phanoteus; and he confirmed his offer by a
regularly sworn treaty. On the appointed day Agetas came
with his Aetolian levy to Phanoteus under cover of night; and
concealing the rest at some little distance, he selected a hundred
of the most active men and sent them towards the citadel. Jason
had Alexander all ready with his soldiers, but duly received
the Aetolians as he had sworn into the citadel. Immediately
Alexander and his men threw themselves into the citadel also:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
the Aetolian hundred picked soldiers were made prisoners;
and when daylight showed Agetas what had taken place, he
drew off his troops,&mdash;baffled by a ruse very like what he had
on many occasions practised himself.</p>

<p><a name="b5_97" id="b5_97"><b>97.</b></a> About this same period King Philip captured Bylazora,

achievement he was all but entirely freed from
any fear of the Dardani, it being no longer easy for them to
invade Macedonia, as long as this city gave Philip the
command of the pass. Having secured this place, he despatched
Chrysogonus with all speed to summon the upper
Macedonians to arms; while he himself, taking on the men of
Bottia and Amphaxitis, arrived at Edessa. Waiting there until
he was joined by the Macedonians under Chrysogonus, he
started with his whole army, and on the sixth day&#8217;s march
arrived at Larisa; and thence by a rapid night
march he came before daybreak to Meliteia, <span class="sidenote">Meliteia.</span>
and placing scaling ladders against the walls, attempted to take
the town by escalade. The suddenness and unexpectedness of
the attack so dismayed the people of Meliteia, that he would
easily have taken the town; but he was baffled by the fact
of the ladders proving to be far too short.</p>

<p><a name="b5_98" id="b5_98"><b>98.</b></a> This is the kind of mistake which above all others
reflects discredit on the commanders. For what can be more
culpable than to arrive at a town which they mean to carry, in
an entirely unprovided state, without having taken the precaution
of measuring walls, cliffs, and the like, by which they
intend to effect their entrance? Or again, while satisfying
themselves as to these measurements, to entrust the construction
of ladders and all such machinery, which, though taking little
time to make, have to stand the test of a very critical service,
without consideration, and to incompetent persons,&mdash;is not
this deserving of censure? For in such actions it is not a
question of succeeding or failing without ill consequences; but
failure is followed by positive damage in manifold respects:
danger to the bravest of the men at the actual time, and still
greater danger during their retreat, when they have once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
incurred the contempt of the enemy. The examples of such
disasters are numerous; for you will find that of those who
have failed in such attempts, many more have perished, or
have been reduced to the last extremity of danger, than have
come off scatheless. Moreover, no one can deny that they
arouse distrust and hatred against themselves for the future,
and give all men warning to be on their guard. For it is not
only the persons attacked, but all who know what has
happened, who are thereby bidden to look out for themselves
and be on the watch. Wherefore it is never right for men
in places of trust to conduct such enterprises inconsiderately.
The method also of taking such measurements, and constructing
machines of this kind, is easy and liable to no
mistakes, if they are taken in hand scientifically.</p>

<p>For the present, however, I must resume the thread of my
narrative, but I shall take another fitting opportunity in the
course of my work to speak of these matters, and will endeavour
to show how mistakes may best be avoided in such
undertakings.</p>

<p><a name="b5_99" id="b5_99"><b>99.</b></a> Thus baffled in his attempt upon Meliteia, Philip encamped
upon the bank of the Enipeus, and collected from
Larisa and the other cities the siege train which he had caused
to be constructed during the winter. <span class="sidenote">Thebae Phthiotides,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>
For the chief object of
his campaign was the capture of the city called
Phthiotid Thebes. Now this city lies no long
way from the sea, about thirty stades from
Larisa, and is conveniently situated in regard both to Magnesia
and Thessaly; but especially as commanding the district
of Demetrias in Magnesia, and of Pharsalus and Pherae in
Thessaly. From it, at that very time, much damage was
being inflicted upon the Demetrians, Pharsalians, and
Larisaeans; as the Aetolians were in occupation of it, and
made continual predatory expeditions, often as far as to the
plain of Amyrus. Philip did not regard the matter as at all
of small importance, but was exceedingly bent on taking the
town. Having therefore got together a hundred and fifty
catapults, and twenty-five stone-throwing ballistae, he sat down
before Thebes. He distributed his forces between three
points in the vicinity of the city; one was encamped near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Scopium; a second near a place called Heliotropium; and the
third on the hill overhanging the town. The spaces between
these camps he fortified by a trench and double palisade, and
further secured them by towers of wood, at intervals of a
hundred feet, with an adequate guard. When these works
were finished, he collected all his siege train together and began
to move his engines towards the citadel.</p>

<p><a name="b5_100" id="b5_100"><b>100.</b></a> For the first three days the king was unable to make
any progress in bringing his machines against
the town, <span class="sidenote">Thebes is taken,
its inhabitants
enslaved, and
its name changed
to Philippopolis.</span>
owing to the gallant and even desperate
defence which the garrison opposed to him.
But when the continual skirmishing, and the
volleys of missiles, had began to tell upon the
defenders, and some of them were killed and others disabled
by wounds; the defence becoming a little slacker, the
Macedonians began sinking mines, and at last after nine days&#8217;
work reached the walls. They then carried on the work by
relays, so as never to leave it off day or night: and thus in three
days had undermined and underpinned two hundred feet of
the wall. The props, however, proved too weak to support
the weight, and gave way; so that the wall fell without the
Macedonians having the trouble of setting fire to them.
When they had worked energetically at clearing the debris, and
had made every preparation for entering by the breach, and
were just on the point of carrying it, the Thebans in a panic
surrendered the town. The security which this achievement
of Philip&#8217;s gave to Magnesia and Thessaly deprived the
Aetolians of a rich field for plunder; and demonstrated to his
army that he had been justified in putting Leontius to death,
for his deliberate treachery in the previous siege of Palae.
Having thus become master of Thebes he sold its existing
inhabitants into slavery, and drafting in some Macedonian
settlers changed its name to Philippopolis.</p>

<p>Just as the king had finished the settlement of Thebes,
ambassadors once more came from Chios, Rhodes, Byzantium,
and King Ptolemy to negotiate terms of peace. He answered
them in much the same terms as he had the former,<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> that he
was not averse to peace; and bade them go and find out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>what the feelings of the Aetolians were. Meanwhile he himself
cared little about making peace, but continued steadily
to prosecute his designs.</p>

<p><a name="b5_101" id="b5_101"><b>101.</b></a> Accordingly, when he heard that the galleys of
Scerdilaidas were committing acts of piracy off Malea, and
treating all merchants as open enemies, and had treacherously
seized some of his own vessels which   were   at anchor at
Leucas, he fitted out twelve decked ships, eight open
vessels, and thirty light craft called hemioliae,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> and sailed
through the Euripus in hot haste to come up with the
Illyrians; exceedingly excited about his plans for carrying
on the war against the Aetolians, as he knew nothing as
yet of what had happened in Italy. For the defeat of the
Romans by Hannibal in Etruria took place while Philip was
besieging Thebes, but the report of that occurrence had not
yet reached Greece. Philip arrived too late to capture the
galleys: and therefore, dropping anchor at Cenchreae, he sent
away his decked ships, with orders to sail round Malea in the
direction of Aegium and Patrae; but having caused the rest of
his vessels to be dragged across the Isthmus, he ordered
them to anchor at Lechaeum; while he went in haste with his
friends to Argos to attend the Nemean festival. <span class="sidenote">Nemean festival.
Midsummer of
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>
Just as he was engaged in watching the gymnastic
contest, a courier arrived from Macedonia
with news of the Romans having been defeated in a great battle,
and of Hannibal being in possession of the open
country. Philip showed the letter to no one at
the moment, except to Demetrius of Pharos,
enjoining him not to say a word. The latter seized the
<span class="sidenote">Philip hears of the
Battle of Thrasymene,
22d June.</span>occasion to advise Philip to throw over the war against the
Aetolians as soon as possible; and to concentrate his efforts
upon Illyria, and an expedition into Italy. &#8220;For Greece,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;is already entirely obedient to you, and will remain so:
the Achaeans from genuine affection; the Aetolians from the
terror which their disasters in the present war have inspired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>them. Italy, and your crossing into it, is the first step in the
acquirement of universal empire, to which no one has a better
claim than yourself. And now is the moment to act when
the Romans have suffered a reverse.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b5_102" id="b5_102"><b>102.</b></a> By using such arguments he found no difficulty in
firing Philip&#8217;s ambition: as was natural, I think, considering
that he was but a youthful monarch, who had as yet been
successful in all his undertakings, and was in any case of a
singularly daring character; and considering too that he was
sprung from a family which above all families has somehow a
tendency to aim at universal monarchy.</p>

<p>At the moment then, as I said, Philip communicated the
news conveyed by the letter to Demetrius alone; and afterwards
summoning a council of his friends consulted them on
the subject of making peace with the Aetolians. And when
even Aratus professed no disinclination to the measure, on the
ground that they would be making peace as conquerors, the
king without waiting for the ambassadors, who were officially
engaged in negotiating its terms, sent Cleonicus of Naupactus
at once to Aetolia, whom he found still awaiting the meeting
of the Achaean league after his captivity;<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> while he himself,
taking his ships and land force from Corinth, came with it to
Aegium. Thence he advanced as far as Lasion and took the
Tower in Perippia, and pretended, in order to avoid appearing
too eager for the conclusion of the war, that he was meditating
an invasion of Elis. <span class="sidenote">A peace congress
summoned.</span>
By this time Cleonicus
had been backwards and forwards two or three
times; and as the Aetolians begged that he
would meet them personally in conference, he assented, and
abandoning all warlike measures, he sent couriers to the allied
cities, bidding their commissioners to sit in the conference
with him and take part in the discussion of the terms of
peace: <span class="sidenote">Zacynthus visited
by Philip.</span>
and then crossed over with his army
and encamped near Panormus, which is a
harbour of the Peloponnese, and lies exactly
opposite Naupactus. There he waited for the commissioners
from the allies, and employed the time required for their
assembling in sailing to Zacynthus, and settling on his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>authority the affairs of the island; and having done so he
sailed back to Panormus.</p>

<p><a name="b5_103" id="b5_103"><b>103.</b></a> The commissioners having now assembled, Philip sent
Aratus and Taurion, and some others who had come with
them, to the Aetolians. They found them in full assembly
at Naupactus; and after a short conference with them, and
satisfying themselves as to their inclination for peace, they
sailed back to Philip to inform him of the state of the case.
But the Aetolians, being very eager to bring the war to a
conclusion, sent ambassadors with them to Philip urging him
to visit them with his army, that by a personal conference the
business might be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
Moved by these representations, <span class="sidenote">Philip goes to
Naupactus.</span>
the king
sailed across with his army to what is
called the Hollows of Naupactus, about
twenty stades from the town. Having pitched a camp there,
and having caused both it and his ships to be surrounded by
a palisade, he waited for the time fixed for the interview.
The Aetolians came <i>en masse</i> without arms; and keeping at a
distance of two stades from Philip&#8217;s camp, interchanged
messages and discussions on the subjects in question. The
negotiation was begun by the king sending all the commissioners
of the allies, with instructions to offer the Aetolians peace, on
the condition of both parties retaining what they then held.
This preliminary the Aetolians readily agreed to; and then
there began a continuous interchange of messages between the
two, most of which I shall omit as containing no point of
interest: but I shall record the speech made by Agelaus of
Naupactus in the first conference before the king and the
assembled allies. It was this.</p>

<p><a name="b5_104" id="b5_104"><b>104.</b></a> &#8220;The best thing of all is that the Greeks should not
go to war with each other at all, but give the
gods hearty thanks if by all speaking with
one voice, <span class="sidenote">Speech of Agelaus
of Naupactus
foreshadowing
the Roman
conquest.</span>
and joining hands like people crossing
a stream, they may be able to repel the
attacks of barbarians and save themselves and
their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the
present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our
guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is
evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public
affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans,
or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable
that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily
and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their
forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore,
I beseech you all to be on your guard against the
danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do
this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and
thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult
on the contrary for their good as you would for your own
person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part
and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the
Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all
your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form
designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the
Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the
west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait
with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity
to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis
unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone
your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater
tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power
of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once
you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon
Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or
war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing
against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the
hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us
only this power of making war or peace with each other at our
own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b5_105" id="b5_105"><b>105.</b></a> This speech of Agelaus greatly influenced the allies
in favour of peace; and Philip more than any
one: <span class="sidenote">The peace is
ratified.</span>
as the arguments employed chimed in with
the wishes which the advice of Demetrius had
already roused in him. Both parties therefore came to terms
on the details of the treaty; and after ratifying it, separated to
their several cities, taking peace with them instead of war.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span></p>

<p>These events all fell in the third year of the 140th Olympiad.
<span class="sidenote">Olympiad 140, 3.

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217.</span>
I mean the battle of the Romans in Etruria,
that of Antiochus for Coele-Syria, and lastly the
treaty between Philip and the Aetolians.</p>

<p>This then was the first point of time, and the first instance
of a deliberation, which may be said to have
regarded the affairs of Greece, <span class="sidenote">The Eastern and
Western politics
become involved
with each other.</span>
Italy, and Libya
as a connected whole: for neither Philip nor the
leading statesmen of the Greek cities made war
or peace any longer with each other with a view to Greek
affairs, but were already all fixing their eyes upon Italy. Nor
was it long before the islanders and inhabitants of Asia
were affected in the same way; for those who were displeased
with Philip, or who had quarrels with Attalus, no longer turned
to Antiochus or Ptolemy, to the south or the east, but from
this time forth fixed their eyes on the west, some sending
embassies to Carthage, others to Rome. The Romans similarly
began sending legates to Greece, alarmed at the daring character
of Philip, and afraid that he might join in the attack upon them
in their present critical position. Having thus fulfilled my
original promise of showing when, how, and why Greek politics
became involved in those of Italy and Libya, I shall now bring
my account of Greek affairs down to the date of the battle of
Cannae, to which I have already brought the history of Italy,
and will end this book at that point.</p>

<p><a name="b5_106" id="b5_106"><b>106.</b></a> Directly the Achaeans had put an end to the war,
they elected Timoxenus Strategus for the next <span class="sidenote">Timoxenus

year<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> and departed to take up once more their
regular ways and habits. Along with the
Achaeans the other Peloponnesian communities
also set to work to repair the losses they had sustained;
recommenced the cultivation of the land; and re-established
their national sacrifices, games, and other religious observances
peculiar to their several states. For these things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
had all but sunk into oblivion in most of the states through
the persistent continuance of the late wars. It has ever
somehow been the case that the Peloponnesians, who of
all men are the most inclined to a peaceful and civilised
way of life, have hitherto enjoyed it less than any other
nation in the world; but have been rather as Euripides<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> says
&#8220;still worn with toil and war&#8217;s unrest.&#8221; But to me it seems clear
that they bring this upon themselves in the natural course of
events: for their universal desire of supremacy, and their obstinate
love of freedom, involve them in perpetual wars with each
other, all alike being resolutely set upon occupying the first place.
<span class="sidenote">Isolation of
Athens.</span>
The Athenians on the contrary had by this time
freed themselves from fear of Macedonia, and
considered that they had now permanently secured
their independence. They accordingly adopted Eurycleidas
and Micion as their representatives, and took no part whatever
in the politics of the rest of Greece; but following the lead
and instigation of these statesmen, they laid themselves out to
flatter all the kings, and Ptolemy most of all; nor was there
any kind of decree or proclamation too fulsome for their
digestion: any consideration of dignity being little regarded,
under the guidance of these vain and frivolous leaders.</p>

<p><a name="b5_107" id="b5_107"><b>107.</b></a> Ptolemy however immediately after these events
became involved in a war with his Egyptian
subjects. <span class="sidenote">Revolt in Egypt.</span>
For in arming them for his campaign
against Antiochus he had taken a step which, while it
served his immediate purpose sufficiently well, proved eventually
disastrous. Elated with their victory at Rhaphia they
refused any longer to receive orders from the king; but looked
out for a leader to represent them, on the ground that they
were quite able to maintain their independence. And this
they succeeded in doing before very long.</p>

<p>Antiochus spent the winter in extensive preparations for
war; and when the next summer came, <span class="sidenote">Winter of
217-216 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.<br />
B.C.</span>216.</span>
he crossed
Mount Taurus and after making a treaty of
alliance with King Attalus entered upon the
war against Achaeus.</p>

<p>At the time the Aetolians were delighted at the settlement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
of peace with the Achaean league, because the war had not
answered to their wishes; and they accordingly
elected Agelaus of Naupactus as their Strategus, <span class="sidenote">Discontent of the
Aetolians with
the peace.</span>
because he was believed to have contributed
more largely than any one to the success of the negotiations.
But this was scarcely arranged before they began to be discontented,
and to find fault with Agelaus for having cut off all
their opportunities of plundering abroad, and all their hopes of
gain for the future, since the peace was not made with certain
definite states, but with all Greeks. But this statesman
patiently endured these unreasonable reproaches and succeeded
in checking the popular impulse. The Aetolians therefore were
forced to acquiesce in an inactivity quite alien to their nature.</p>

<p><a name="b5_108" id="b5_108"><b>108.</b></a> King Philip having returned, after the completion of
the treaty of peace, to Macedonia by sea, <span class="sidenote">Philip&#8217;s war
against Scerdilaidas
of Illyria,
autumn of
217&nbsp;<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></span>
found
that Scerdilaidas on the same pretext of money
owed to him, on which he had treacherously
seized the vessels at Leucas, had now plundered
a town in Pelagonia called Pissaeum; had won
over by promises some cities of the Dassaretae, namely, Phibotides,
Antipatria, Chrysondym, and Geston; and had overrun
much of the district of Macedonia bordering on these places.
He therefore at once started with his army in great haste to
recover the revolted cities, and determined to proclaim open
war with Scerdilaidas; for he thought it a matter of the most
vital importance to bring Illyria into a state of good order, with
a view to the success of all his projects, and above all of his
passage into Italy. For Demetrius was so assiduous in
keeping hot these hopes and projects in the king&#8217;s mind, that
Philip even dreamed of them in his sleep, and thought of
nothing else but this Italian expedition. The motive of
Demetrius in so acting was not a consideration for Philip, for
he certainly did not rank higher than third in the calculations
of Demetrius. A stronger motive than that was his hatred of
Rome: but the strongest of all was the consideration of his
own prospects. For he had made up his mind that it was
only in this way that he could ever recover his principality in
Pharos. Be that as it may, Philip went on his expedition and
recovered the cities I have named, and took besides Creonium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
and Gerus in Dassaretis; Enchelanae, Cerax, Sation, Boei, round
the Lychnidian Lake; Bantia in the district of the Calicoeni;
and Orgyssus in that of the Pisantini. After completing these
operations he dismissed his troops to their winter quarters.</p>

<p>This was the winter in which Hannibal, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;217-216.<br /><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216.

after plundering

his winter quarters near Geranium in Daunia.
And it was then that at Rome Caius Terentius
and Lucius Aemilius entered upon their
Consulship.</p>

<p><a name="b5_109" id="b5_109"><b>109.</b></a> In the course of the winter, Philip, taking into
consideration that he would want ships to
carry out his designs, <span class="sidenote">Philip&#8217;s preparation
for an
invasion of Italy.</span>
and men for rowing, not
for fighting,&mdash;for he could never have even
entertained a hope of fighting the Romans at sea,-&#8212;but rather
for the transport of soldiers, and to enable him to cross with
greater speed to any point to which he might desire to go,
and so surprise the enemy by a sudden appearance, and
thinking that the Illyrian build was the best for the sort of
ships he wanted, determined to have a hundred galleys built;
which hardly any Macedonian king had ever done before.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216.</span>
Having had these fitted out, he collected his
forces at the beginning of the summer; and, after
a brief training of the Macedonians in rowing them, put to sea.
It was just at the time that Antiochus crossed Mount Taurus
when Philip, after sailing through the Euripus and rounding
Cape Malea, came to Cephallenia and Leucas, where he
dropped anchor, and awaited anxiously the movements of the
Roman fleet. Being informed that it was at anchor off Lilybaeum,
he mustered up courage to put to sea, and steered for
Apollonia.</p>

<p><a name="b5_110" id="b5_110"><b>110.</b></a> As he neared the mouth of the Aous, which flows
past Apollonia, a panic fell upon his fleet such
as happens to land forces. <span class="sidenote">Panic-stricken at
the reported
approach of a
Roman squadron,
Philip retreats to
Cephallenia.</span>
Certain galleys on
the rear of the fleet being anchored at an island
called Sason, which lies at the entrance to the
Ionian Sea, came by night to Philip with a
report that some men who had lately come from
the Sicilian Strait had been anchored with them at Sason, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
reported that they left some Roman quinqueremes at Rhegium,
which were bound for Apollonia to support Scerdilaidas. Thinking
this fleet must be all but upon him, Philip, in great alarm,
promptly ordered his ships to weigh anchor and sail back the
way they came. They started and got out to sea in great
disorder, and reached Cephallenia, after sailing two nights and
days without intermission. Having now partially recovered
his courage, Philip remained there, covering his flight under the
pretext of having returned for some operations in the Peloponnese.
It turned out that it was a false alarm altogether.
The truth was that Scerdilaidas, hearing in the course of the
winter that Philip was having a number of galleys built, and
expecting him to come to attack him by sea, had sent
messages to Rome stating the facts and imploring help; and
the Romans had detached a squadron of ten ships from the
fleet at Lilybaeum, which were what had been seen at
Rhegium. But if Philip had not fled from them in such
inconsiderate alarm, he would have had the best opportunity
possible of attaining his objects in Illyria; because the thoughts
and resources of Rome were absorbed in the war with
Hannibal and the battle of Cannae, and it may fairly be presumed
that he would have captured the ten Roman ships. As
it was, he was utterly upset by the news and returned to
Macedonia, without loss indeed, but with considerable dishonour.</p>

<p><a name="b5_111" id="b5_111"><b>111.</b></a> During this period Prusias also did a thing which
deserves to be recorded. The Gauls, whom <span class="sidenote">Prusias and the
Gauls.
See ch. <a href="#b5_78">78</a>.</span>
King Attalus had brought over from Europe to
assist him against Achaeus on account of their
reputation for courage, had separated from that monarch on
account of the jealous suspicions of which I have before spoken,
and were plundering the cities on the Hellespont with gross
licentiousness and violence, and finally went so far as actually
to besiege Ilium. In these circumstances the inhabitants of
the Alexandria in the Troad acted with commendable spirit.
They sent Themistes with four thousand men and forced the
Gauls to raise the siege of Ilium, and drove them entirely out of
the Troad, by cutting off their supplies and frustrating all their
designs. Thereupon the Gauls seized Arisba, in the territory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
of Abydos, and thenceforth devoted themselves to forming
designs and committing acts of hostility against the cities
built in that district. Against them Prusias led out an army;
and in a pitched battle put the men to the sword on the field, and
slew nearly all their women and children in the camp, leaving
the baggage to be plundered by his soldiers. This achievement
of Prusias delivered the cities on the Hellespont from
great fear and danger, and was a signal warning for future
generations against barbarians from Europe being over-ready
to cross into Asia.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs in Greece and Asia. Meanwhile
the greater part of Italy had joined the Carthaginians
after the battle of Cannae, as I have shown before. I will
interrupt my narrative at this point, after having detailed
the events in Asia and Greece, embraced by the 140th
Olympiad. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;220-216.</span>
In my next book after a brief
recapitulation of this narrative, I shall fulfil
the promise made at the beginning of my work by recurring
to the discussion of the Roman constitution.</p>

<h2>BOOK VI</h2>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p><a name="b6_1" id="b6_1"><b>1.</b></a> <span class="smcap">I am</span> aware that some will be at a loss to account for
my interrupting the course of my narrative for the sake
of entering upon the following disquisition on the Roman
constitution. But I think that I have already in many
passages made it fully evident that this particular branch of my
work was one of the necessities imposed on me by the nature of
my original design; and I pointed this out with special clearness
in the preface which explained the scope of my history.
I there stated that the feature of my work which was at once
the best in itself, and the most instructive to the students of it,
was that it would enable them to know and fully realise in
what manner, and under what kind of constitution, it came
about that nearly the whole world fell under the power of Rome
in somewhat less than fifty-three years,&mdash;an event certainly
without precedent. This being my settled purpose, I could
see no more fitting period than the present for making a pause,
and examining the truth of the remarks about to be made on
this constitution. In private life if you wish to satisfy yourself
as to the badness or goodness of particular persons, you would
not, if you wish to get a genuine test, examine their conduct
at a time of uneventful repose, but in the hour of brilliant
success or conspicuous reverse. For the true test of a perfect
man is the power of bearing with spirit and dignity violent
changes of fortune. An examination of a constitution should
be conducted in the same way: and therefore being unable to
find in our day a more rapid or more signal change than
that which has happened to Rome, I reserved my disquisition
on its constitution for this place....</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span></p>

<p>What is really educational and beneficial to students of
history is the clear view of the causes of events, and the consequent
power of choosing the better policy in a particular
case. Now in every practical undertaking by a state we must
regard as the most powerful agent for success or failure the
form of its constitution; for from this as from a fountain-head
all conceptions and plans of action not only proceed, but
attain their consummation.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a>...</p>

<p class="tb"><a name="b6_3" id="b6_3"><b>3.</b></a> Of the Greek republics, which have again and again
risen to greatness and fallen into insignificance, it is not difficult
to speak, whether we recount their past history or venture an
opinion on their future. For to report what is already known
is an easy task, nor is it hard to guess what is to come from
our knowledge of what has been. But in regard to the
Romans it is neither an easy matter to describe their present
state, owing to the complexity of their constitution; nor to
speak with confidence of their future, from our inadequate
acquaintance with their peculiar institutions in the past whether
affecting their public or their private life. It will require then
no ordinary attention and study to get a clear and comprehensive
conception of the distinctive features of this constitution.</p>

<p>Now, it is undoubtedly the case that most of those who
profess to give us authoritative instruction <span class="sidenote">Classification of
polities.</span>
on this subject distinguish three kinds of
constitutions, which they designate <i>kingship</i>,
<i>aristocracy</i>, <i>democracy</i>. But in my opinion the question
might fairly be put to them, whether they name these as
being the <i>only</i> ones, or as the <i>best</i>. In either case I think
they are wrong. For it is plain that we must regard as the
<i>best</i> constitution that which partakes of all these three
elements. And this is no mere assertion, but has been proved
by the example of Lycurgus, who was the first to construct a
constitution&mdash;that of Sparta&mdash;on this principle. Nor can we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>admit that these are the <i>only</i> forms: for we have had before
now examples of absolute and tyrannical forms of government,
which, while differing as widely as possible from kingship, yet
appear to have some points of resemblance to it; on which
account all absolute rulers falsely assume and use, as far as
they can, the title of king. Again there have been many
instances of oligarchical governments having in appearance
some analogy to aristocracies, which are, if I may say so, as
different from them as it is possible to be. The same also
holds good about democracy.</p>

<p><a name="b6_4" id="b6_4"><b>4.</b></a> I will illustrate the truth of what I say. We cannot
hold every absolute government to be a kingship,
but only that which is accepted voluntarily, <span class="sidenote">Six forms of
polity, and their
natural cycle.</span>
and is directed by an appeal to reason
rather than to fear and force. Nor again is every oligarchy
to be regarded as an aristocracy; the latter exists only
where the power is wielded by the justest and wisest men
selected on their merits. Similarly, it is not enough to constitute
a democracy that the whole crowd of citizens should
have the right to do whatever they wish or propose. But
where reverence to the gods, succour of parents, respect to
elders, obedience to laws, are traditional and habitual, in such
communities, if the will of the majority prevail, we may speak
of the form of government as a democracy. So then we
enumerate six forms of government,&mdash;the three commonly
spoken of which I have just mentioned, and three more allied
forms, I mean <i>despotism</i>, <i>oligarchy</i> and <i>mob-rule</i>. The first
of these arises without artificial aid and in the natural order of
events. Next to this, and produced from it by the aid of art
and adjustment, comes <i>kingship</i>; which degenerating into the
evil form allied to it, by which I mean <i>tyranny</i>, both are once
more destroyed and <i>aristocracy</i> produced. Again the latter
being in the course of nature perverted to <i>oligarchy</i>, and the
people passionately avenging the unjust acts of their rulers,
<i>democracy</i> comes into existence; which again by its violence
and contempt of law becomes sheer <i>mob-rule</i>.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> No clearer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>proof of the truth of what I say could be obtained than by a
careful observation of the natural origin, genesis, and decadence
of these several forms of government. For it is only by seeing
distinctly how each of them is produced that a distinct view
can also be obtained of its growth, zenith, and decadence,
and the time, circumstance, and place in which each of these
may be expected to recur. This method I have assumed to
be especially applicable to the Roman constitution, because
its origin and growth have from the first followed natural
causes.</p>

<p><a name="b6_5" id="b6_5"><b>5.</b></a> Now the natural laws which regulate the merging of one
form of government into another are perhaps discussed with
greater accuracy by Plato and some other philosophers. But
their treatment, from its intricacy and exhaustiveness, is only
within the capacity of a few. I will therefore endeavour to
give a summary of the subject, just so far as I suppose it to fall
within the scope of a practical history and the intelligence of
ordinary people. For if my exposition appear in any way
inadequate, owing to the general terms in which it is expressed,
the details contained in what is immediately to follow will
amply atone for what is left for the present unsolved.</p>

<p>What is the origin then of a constitution, and whence is it
produced? Suppose that from floods, pestilences, failure of crops,
<span class="sidenote">The origin of
the social
compact.</span>
or some such causes the race of man is reduced almost to extinction.
Such things we are told have happened, and it is
reasonable to think will happen again. Suppose accordingly
all knowledge of social habits and arts to have been lost.
Suppose that from the survivors, as from seeds, the race of
man to have again multiplied. In that case I presume they
would, like the animals, herd together; for it is but reasonable
to suppose that bodily weakness would induce them to seek
those of their own kind to herd with. And in that case too,
as with the animals, he who was superior to the rest in strength
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>of body or courage of soul would lead and rule them. For
what we see happen in the case of animals that are without the
faculty of reason, such as bulls, goats, and cocks,&mdash;among
whom there can be no dispute that the strongest take the lead,&mdash;that
we must regard as in the truest sense the teaching of
nature. Originally then it is probable that the condition of
life among men was this,&mdash;herding together like animals and
following the strongest and bravest as leaders. The limit of
this authority would be physical strength, and the name we
should give it would be despotism. But as soon as the idea
of family ties and social relation has arisen amongst such
agglomerations of men, then is born also the idea of kingship,
and then for the first time mankind conceives the notion of
goodness and justice and their reverse.</p>

<p><a name="b6_6" id="b6_6"><b>6.</b></a> The way in which such conceptions originate and come
into existence is this. The intercourse of
the sexes is an instinct of nature, <span class="sidenote">Origin of
morality,</span>
and the
result is the birth of children. Now, if any
one of these children who have been brought up, when
arrived at maturity, is ungrateful and makes no return to those
by whom he was nurtured, but on the contrary presumes to
injure them by word and deed, it is plain that he will probably
offend and annoy such as are present, and have seen the care
and trouble bestowed by the parents on the nurture and
bringing up of their children. For seeing that men differ from
the other animals in being the only creatures possessed of
reasoning powers, it is clear that such a difference of conduct
is not likely to escape their observation; but that they will
remark it when it occurs, and express their displeasure on the
spot: because they will have an eye to the future, and will
reason on the likelihood of the same occurring to each of
themselves. Again, if a man has been rescued or helped in
an hour of danger, and, instead of showing gratitude to his
preserver, seeks to do him harm, it is clearly probable that the
rest will be displeased and offended with him, when they know
it: sympathising with their neighbour and imagining themselves
in his case. Hence arises a notion in every breast of the
meaning and theory of duty, which is in fact the beginning
and end of justice. Similarly, again, when any one man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
stands out as the champion of all in a time of danger, and
braves with firm courage the onslaught of the most powerful
wild beasts, it is probable that such a man would meet with
marks of favour and pre-eminence from the common people;
while he who acted in a contrary way would fall under their
contempt and dislike. From this, once more, it is reasonable
to suppose that there would arise in the minds of the multitude
a theory of the disgraceful and the
honourable, <span class="sidenote">which transmutes
despotism into
kingship,</span>
and of the difference between
them; and that one should be sought and
imitated for its advantages, the other shunned. When, therefore,
the leading and most powerful man among his people
ever encourages such persons in accordance with the popular
sentiment, and thereby assumes in the eyes of his subject the
appearance of being the distributor to each man according to
his deserts, they no longer obey him and support his rule from
fear of violence, but rather from conviction of its utility, however
old he may be, rallying round him with one heart and soul,
and fighting against all who form designs against his government.
In this way he becomes a <i>king</i> instead of a <i>despot</i> by
imperceptible degrees, reason having ousted brute courage and
bodily strength from their supremacy.</p>

<p><a name="b6_7" id="b6_7"><b>7.</b></a> This then is the natural process of formation among
mankind of the notion of goodness and justice, and their
opposites; and this is the origin and genesis of genuine kingship;
for people do not only keep up the government of such
men personally, but for their descendants also for many generations;
from the conviction that those who are born from and
educated by men of this kind will have principles also like
theirs. But if they subsequently become displeased with their
descendants, they do not any longer decide their choice of
rulers and kings by their physical strength or brute courage;
but by the differences of their intellectual and reasoning
faculties, from practical experience of the decisive importance
of such a distinction. In old times, then, <span class="sidenote">which in its turn
degenerates into
tyranny.</span>
those who were once thus selected, and obtained
this office, grew old in their royal
functions, making magnificent strongholds and surrounding
them with walls and extending their frontiers, partly for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
security of their subjects, and partly to provide them with
abundance of the necessaries of life; and while engaged in
these works they were exempt from all vituperation or jealousy;
because they did not make their distinctive dress, food, or drink,
at all conspicuous, but lived very much like the rest, and joined
in the everyday employments of the common people. But
when their royal power became hereditary in their family, and
they found every necessary for security ready to their hands,
as well as more than was necessary for their personal support,
then they gave the rein to their appetites; imagined that
rulers must needs wear different clothes from those of
subjects; have different and elaborate luxuries of the table;
and must even seek sensual indulgence, however unlawful the
source, without fear of denial. These things having given rise
in the one case to jealousy and offence, in the other to outburst
of hatred and passionate resentment, the kingship
became a tyranny; the first step in disintegration was taken;
and plots began to be formed against the government, which
did not now proceed from the worst men but from the noblest,
most high-minded, and most courageous, because these are
the men who can least submit to the tyrannical acts of their
rulers.</p>

<p><a name="b6_8" id="b6_8"><b>8.</b></a> But as soon as the people got leaders, they co-operated
with them against the dynasty for
the reasons I have mentioned; <span class="sidenote">Tyranny is then
displaced by
aristocracy,</span>
and then
<i>kingship</i> and <i>despotism</i> were alike entirely
abolished, and <i>aristocracy</i> once more began to revive and
start afresh. For in their immediate gratitude to those
who had deposed the despots, the people employed them as
leaders, and entrusted their interests to them; who, looking
upon this charge at first as a great privilege, made the public
advantage their chief concern, and conducted all kinds of
business, public or private, with diligence and caution. But
when the sons of these men received the same position of
authority from their fathers,&mdash;having had no experience of
misfortunes, and none at all of civil equality and freedom of
speech, but having been bred up from the first under the
shadow of their fathers&#8217; authority and lofty position,&mdash;some
of them gave themselves up with passion to avarice and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
unscrupulous love of money, others to drinking and the
boundless debaucheries which accompanies it, <span class="sidenote">which degenerates
into oligarchy,</span>
and others to the violation of women or the
forcible appropriation of boys; and so they
turned an <i>aristocracy</i> into an <i>oligarchy</i>. But it was
not long before they roused in the minds of the people the same
feelings as before; and their fall therefore was very like the
disaster which befell the tyrants.</p>

<p><a name="b6_9" id="b6_9"><b>9.</b></a> For no sooner had the knowledge of the jealousy and
hatred existing in the citizens against them <span class="sidenote">which is replaced
by democracy,</span>
emboldened some one to oppose the government
by word or deed, than he was sure to
find the whole people ready and prepared to take his side.
Having then got rid of these rulers by assassination or exile,
they do not venture to set up a king again, being still in terror
of the injustice to which this led before; nor dare they intrust
the common interests again to more than one, considering the
recent example of their misconduct: and therefore, as the only
sound hope left them is that which depends upon themselves,
they are driven to take refuge in that; and so changed the
constitution from an oligarchy to a <i>democracy</i>, and took upon
themselves the superintendence and charge of the state. And
as long as any survive who have had experience of oligarchical
supremacy and domination, they regard their present constitution
as a blessing, and hold equality and freedom as
of the utmost value. But as soon as a new generation has
arisen, and the democracy has descended to their children&#8217;s
children, long association weakens their value for equality
and freedom, and some seek to become more powerful
than the ordinary citizens; and the most liable to this temptation
are the rich. <span class="sidenote">which degenerates
into rule of corruption
and violence,
only to be
stopped by a return
to despotism.</span>
So when they begin to be fond of office,
and find themselves unable to obtain it by
their own unassisted efforts and their own
merits, they ruin their estates, while enticing
and corrupting the common people in every
possible way. By which means when, in their
senseless mania for reputation, they have made
the populace ready and greedy to receive bribes, the virtue of
democracy is destroyed, and it is transformed into a government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
of violence and the strong hand. For the mob,
habituated to feed at the expense of others, and to have its
hopes of a livelihood in the property of its neighbours, as soon
as it has got a leader sufficiently ambitious and daring, being
excluded by poverty from the sweets of civil honours, produces
a reign of mere violence. Then come tumultuous
assemblies, massacres, banishments, redivisions of land; until,
after losing all trace of civilisation, it has once more found a
master and a despot.</p>

<p>This is the regular cycle of constitutional revolutions, and
the natural order in which constitutions change, are transformed,
and return again to their original stage. If a man
have a clear grasp of these principles he may perhaps make a
mistake as to the dates at which this or that will happen to a
particular constitution; but he will rarely be entirely mistaken
as to the stage of growth or decay at which it has arrived, or
as to the point at which it will undergo some revolutionary
change. However, it is in the case of the Roman constitution
that this method of inquiry will most fully teach us its
formation, its growth, and zenith, as well as the changes
awaiting it in the future; for this, if any constitution ever did,
owed, as I said just now, its original foundation and growth
to natural causes, and to natural causes will owe its decay. My
subsequent narrative will be the best illustration of what I say.</p>

<p><a name="b6_10" id="b6_10"><b>10.</b></a> For the present I will make a brief reference to the
legislation of Lycurgus: for such a discussion
is not at all alien to my subject. <span class="sidenote">Lycurgus recognized
these truths,
and legislated
accordingly.</span>
That statesman
was fully aware that all those changes
which I have enumerated come about by an
undeviating law of nature; and reflected that every form of
government that was unmixed, and rested on one species of
power, was unstable; because it was swiftly perverted into that
particular form of evil peculiar to it and inherent in its nature.
For just as rust is the natural dissolvent of iron, wood-worms
and grubs to timber, by which they are destroyed without any
external injury, but by that which is engendered in themselves;
so in each constitution there is naturally engendered a particular
vice inseparable from it: in kingship it is absolutism;
aristocracy it is oligarchy; in democracy lawless ferocity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
violence; and to these vicious states all these forms of government
are, as I have lately shown, inevitably transformed.
Lycurgus, I say, saw all this, and accordingly combined
together all the excellences and distinctive features of the best
constitutions, that no part should become unduly predominant,
and be perverted into its kindred vice; and that, each power
being checked by the others, no one part should turn the scale
or decisively out-balance the others; but that, by being
accurately adjusted and in exact equilibrium, the whole might
remain long steady like a ship sailing close to the wind. The
royal power was prevented from growing insolent by fear of
the people, which had also assigned to it an adequate share
in the constitution. The people in their turn were restrained
from a bold contempt of the kings by fear of
the Gerusia: the members of which, being selected on grounds
of merit, were certain to throw their influence on the side of
justice in every question that arose; and thus the party placed
at a disadvantage by its conservative tendency was always
strengthened and supported by the weight and influence of
the Gerusia. The result of this combination has been that the
Lacedaemonians retained their freedom for the longest period
of any people with which we are acquainted.</p>

<p>Lycurgus however established his constitution without the
discipline of adversity, because he was able to foresee by the
light of reason the course which events naturally take and the
source from which they come. But though the Romans have
arrived at the same result in framing their commonwealth, they
have not done so by means of abstract reasoning, but through
many struggles and difficulties, and by continually adopting
reforms from knowledge gained in disaster. The result has
been a constitution like that of Lycurgus, and the best of any
existing in my time....</p>

<p class="tb"><a name="b6_11" id="b6_11"><b>11.</b></a> I have given an account of the constitution of Lycurgus,
I will now endeavour to describe that of Rome at the period
of their disastrous defeat at Cannae.</p>

<p>I am fully conscious that to those who actually live under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
this constitution I shall appear to give an inadequate account
of it by the omission of certain details. <span class="sidenote">The Roman constitution
at the
epoch of Cannae,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216.</span>
Knowing
accurately every portion of it from personal
experience, and from having been bred up in
its customs and laws from childhood, they will
not be struck so much by the accuracy of the description,
as annoyed by its omissions; nor will they believe that the
historian has purposely omitted unimportant distinctions, but
will attribute his silence upon the origin of existing institutions
or other important facts to ignorance. What is told they depreciate
as insignificant or beside the purpose; what is omitted
they desiderate as vital to the question: their object being to
appear to know more than the writers. But a good critic
should not judge a writer by what he leaves unsaid, but from
what he says: if he detects misstatement in the latter, he may
then feel certain that ignorance accounts for the former; but
if what he says is accurate, his omissions ought to be attributed
to deliberate judgment and not to ignorance. So much for
those whose criticisms are prompted by personal ambition
rather than by justice....</p>

<p>Another requisite for obtaining a judicious approval for an
historical disquisition, is that it should be germane to the
matter in hand; if this is not observed, though its style may
be excellent and its matter irreproachable, it will seem out of
place, and disgust rather than please....</p>

<p>As for the Roman constitution, it had three elements,
each of them possessing sovereign powers: <span class="sidenote">Triple element in
the Roman
Constitution.</span>
and their respective share of power in the
whole state had been regulated with such a
scrupulous regard to equality and equilibrium, that no one
could say for certain, not even a native, whether the constitution
as a whole were an aristocracy or democracy or
despotism. And no wonder: for if we confine our observation
to the power of the Consuls we should be inclined to regard it
as despotic; if on that of the Senate, as aristocratic; and
if finally one looks at the power possessed by the people it
would seem a clear case of a democracy. What the exact
powers of these several parts were, and still, with slight modifications,
are, I will now state.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b6_12" id="b6_12"><b>12.</b></a> The Consuls, before leading out the legions, remain
in Rome and are supreme masters of the
administration. <span class="sidenote">The Consuls.</span>
All other magistrates, except
the Tribunes, are under them and take their orders. They
introduce foreign ambassadors to the Senate; bring matters
requiring deliberation before it; and see to the execution
of its decrees. If, again, there are any matters of state
which require the authorisation of the people, it is their
business to see to them, to summon the popular meetings, to
bring the proposals before them, and to carry out the decrees
of the majority. In the preparations for war also, and in a
word in the entire administration of a campaign, they have all
but absolute power. It is competent to them to impose on
the allies such levies as they think good, to appoint the
Military Tribunes, to make up the roll for soldiers and select
those that are suitable. Besides they have absolute power of
inflicting punishment on all who are under their command
while on active service and they have authority to expend as
much of the public money as they choose, being accompanied
by a quaestor who is entirely at their orders. A survey of
these powers would in fact justify our describing the constitution
as despotic,&mdash;a clear case of royal government.
Nor will it affect the truth of my description, if any of the
institutions I have described are changed in our time, or in
that of our posterity: and the same remarks apply to what
follows.</p>

<p><a name="b6_13" id="b6_13"><b>13.</b></a> The Senate has first of all the control of the treasury,
and regulates the receipts and disbursements
alike. <span class="sidenote">The Senate.</span>
For the Quaestors cannot issue any
public money for the various departments of the state
without a decree of the Senate, except for the service of
the Consuls. The Senate controls also what is by far the
largest and most important expenditure, that, namely, which
is made by the censors every <i>lustrum</i> for the repair or construction
of public buildings; this money cannot be obtained
by the censors except by the grant of the Senate. Similarly all
crimes committed in Italy requiring a public investigation,
such as treason, conspiracy, poisoning, or wilful murder, are
in the hands of the Senate. Besides, if any individual or state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
among the Italian allies requires a controversy to be settled, a
penalty to be assessed, help or protection to be afforded,&mdash;all
this is the province of the Senate. Or again, outside Italy, if
it is necessary to send an embassy to reconcile warring communities,
or to remind them of their duty, or sometimes to
impose requisitions upon them, or to receive their submission,
or finally to proclaim war against them,&mdash;this too is the business
of the Senate. In like manner the reception to be given
to foreign ambassadors in Rome, and the answers to be returned
to them, are decided by the Senate. With such business
the people have nothing to do. Consequently, if one
were staying at Rome when the Consuls were not in town, one
would imagine the constitution to be a complete aristocracy:
and this has been the idea entertained by many Greeks, and
by many kings as well, from the fact that nearly all the business
they had with Rome was settled by the Senate.</p>

<p><a name="b6_14" id="b6_14"><b>14.</b></a> After this one would naturally be inclined to ask
what part is left for the people in the constitution, <span class="sidenote">The people.</span>
when the Senate has these various
functions, especially the control of the receipts and expenditure
of the exchequer; and when the Consuls, again,
have absolute power over the details of military preparation,
and an absolute authority in the field? There is, however,
a part left the people, and it is a most important one.
For the people is the sole fountain of honour and of punishment;
and it is by these two things and these alone that
dynasties and constitutions and, in a word, human society are
held together: for where the distinction between them is not
sharply drawn both in theory and practice, there no undertaking
can be properly administered,&mdash;as indeed we might expect
when good and bad are held in exactly the same honour.
The people then are the only court to decide matters of life
and death; and even in cases where the penalty is money, if
the sum to be assessed is sufficiently serious, and especially
when the accused have held the higher magistracies. And in
regard to this arrangement there is one point deserving especial
commendation and record. Men who are on trial for their
lives at Rome, while sentence is in process of being voted,&mdash;if
even only one of the tribes whose votes are needed to ratify the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
sentence has not voted,&mdash;have the privilege at Rome of openly
departing and condemning themselves to a voluntary exile.
Such men are safe at Naples or Praeneste or at Tibur, and
at other towns with which this arrangement has been duly
ratified on oath.</p>

<p>Again, it is the people who bestow offices on the deserving,
which are the most honourable rewards of virtue. It has also
the absolute power of passing or repealing laws; and, most
important of all, it is the people who deliberate on the question
of peace or war. And when provisional terms are made for
alliance, suspension of hostilities, or treaties, it is the people
who ratify them or the reverse.</p>

<p>These considerations again would lead one to say that the
chief power in the state was the people&#8217;s, and that the constitution
was a democracy.</p>

<p><a name="b6_15" id="b6_15"><b>15.</b></a> Such, then, is the distribution of power between the
several parts of the state. <span class="sidenote">The mutual
relation of the
three.</span>
I must now show
how each of these several parts can, when they
choose, oppose or support each other.</p>

<p>The Consul, then, when he has started on an expedition
with the powers I have described, is to all <span class="sidenote">The Consul
dependent on
the Senate,</span>
appearance absolute in the administration of
the business in hand; still he has need of
the support both of people and Senate, and, without them,
is quite unable to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.
For it is plain that he must have supplies sent to his
legions from time to time; but without a decree of the Senate
they can be supplied neither with corn, nor clothes, nor pay,
so that all the plans of a commander must be futile, if the
Senate is resolved either to shrink from danger or hamper his
plans. And again, whether a Consul shall bring any undertaking
to a conclusion or no depends entirely upon the Senate:
for it has absolute authority at the end of a year to send another
Consul to supersede him, or to continue the existing one
in his command. Again, even to the successes of the generals
the Senate has the power to add distinction and glory, and on
the other hand to obscure their merits and lower their credit.
For these high achievements are brought in tangible form before
the eyes of the citizens by what are called &#8220;triumphs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span></p>

<p>But these triumphs the commanders cannot celebrate with
proper pomp, or in some cases celebrate at all, unless the
Senate concurs and grants the necessary money. <span class="sidenote">and on the
people.</span>
As for the
people, the Consuls are pre-eminently obliged
to court their favour, however distant from
home may be the field of their operations; for
it is the people, as I have said before, that ratifies, or refuses
to ratify, terms of peace and treaties; but most of all because
when laying down their office they have to give an account<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a>
of their administration before it. Therefore in no case is it
safe for the Consuls to neglect either the Senate or the goodwill
of the people.</p>

<p><a name="b6_16" id="b6_16"><b>16.</b></a> As for the Senate, which possesses the immense
power I have described, in the first place
it is obliged in public affairs to take the
multitude into account, <span class="sidenote">The Senate controlled
by the
people.</span>
and respect the
wishes of the people; and it cannot put into execution the
penalty for offences against the republic, which are punishable
with death, unless the people first ratify its decrees.
Similarly even in matters which directly affect the senators,&mdash;for
instance, in the case of a law diminishing the Senate&#8217;s
traditional authority, or depriving senators of certain dignities
and offices, or even actually cutting down their property,&mdash;even
in such cases the people have the sole power of passing
or rejecting the law. But most important of all is the fact
that, if the Tribunes interpose their veto, the Senate not only
are unable to pass a decree, but cannot even hold a meeting
at all, whether formal or informal. Now, the Tribunes are
always bound to carry out the decree of the people, and above
all things to have regard to their wishes: therefore, for all these
reasons the Senate stands in awe of the multitude, and cannot
neglect the feelings of the people.</p>

<p><a name="b6_17" id="b6_17"><b>17.</b></a> In like manner the people on its part is far from
being independent of the Senate, and is bound to take its
wishes into account both collectively and individually. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
contracts, too numerous to count, are given out by the
censors in all parts of Italy for the repairs
or construction of public buildings; <span class="sidenote">The people
dependent on
the Senate.</span>
there
is also the collection of revenue from many
rivers, harbours, gardens, mines, and land&mdash;everything, in a
word, that comes under the control of the Roman government:
and in all these the people at large are engaged; so that there
is scarcely a man, so to speak, who is not interested either as
a contractor or as being employed in the works. For some
purchase the contracts from the censors for themselves; and
others go partners with them; while others again go security
for these contractors, or actually pledge their property to the
treasury for them. Now over all these transactions the Senate
has absolute control. It can grant an extension of time; and
in case of unforeseen accident can relieve the contractors from
a portion of their obligation, or release them from it altogether,
if they are absolutely unable to fulfil it. And there are many
details in which the Senate can inflict great hardships, or, on
the other hand, grant great indulgences to the contractors: for
in every case the appeal is to it. But the most important
point of all is that the judges are taken from its members in
the majority of trials, whether public or private, in which the
charges are heavy.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> Consequently, all citizens are much at its
mercy; and being alarmed at the uncertainty as to when they
may need its aid, are cautious about resisting or actively
opposing its will. <span class="sidenote">and Consul.</span>
And for a similar reason
men do not rashly resist the wishes of the
Consuls, because one and all may become subject to their
absolute authority on a campaign.</p>

<p><a name="b6_18" id="b6_18"><b>18.</b></a> The result of this power of the several estates for
mutual help or harm is a union sufficiently firm for all emergencies,
and a constitution than which it is impossible to find
a better. For whenever any danger from without compels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>them to unite and work together, the strength which is developed
by the State is so extraordinary, that everything required
is unfailingly carried out by the eager rivalry shown by all
classes to devote their whole minds to the need of the hour,
and to secure that any determination come to should not fail
for want of promptitude; while each individual works, privately
and publicly alike, for the accomplishment of the business in
hand. Accordingly, the peculiar constitution of the State
makes it irresistible, and certain of obtaining whatever it
determines to attempt. Nay, even when these external alarms
are past, and the people are enjoying their good fortune and
the fruits of their victories, and, as usually happens, growing
corrupted by flattery and idleness, show a tendency to violence
and arrogance,&mdash;it is in these circumstances, more than ever,
that the constitution is seen to possess within itself the power
of correcting abuses. For when any one of the three classes
becomes puffed up, and manifests an inclination to be contentious
and unduly encroaching, the mutual interdependency
of all the three, and the possibility of the pretensions of any
one being checked and thwarted by the others, must plainly
check this tendency: and so the proper equilibrium is maintained
by the impulsiveness of the one part being checked
by its fear of the other....</p>

<h3>ON THE ROMAN ARMY</h3>

<p><a name="b6_19" id="b6_19"><b>19.</b></a> After electing the Consuls they proceed to elect military
tribunes,&mdash;fourteen from those who had five years&#8217;, and
ten from those who had ten years&#8217;, service. All citizens must
serve ten years in the cavalry or twenty years in the infantry
before the forty-sixth year of their age, except those rated
below four hundred asses. The latter are employed in the
navy; but if any great public necessity arises they are obliged
to serve as infantry also for twenty campaigns: and no one can
hold an office in the state until he has completed ten years of
military service....</p>

<p>When the Consuls are about to enrol the army they
give public notice of the day on which all
Roman citizens of military age must appear. <span class="sidenote">The levy.</span>
This is done every year. When the day has arrived,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
and the citizens fit for service are come to Rome and
have assembled on the Capitoline, the fourteen junior
tribunes divide themselves, in the order in which they were
appointed by the people or by the Imperators, into four
divisions, because the primary division of the forces thus raised
is into four legions. The four tribunes first appointed are
assigned to the legion called the 1st; the next three to the
2d; the next four to the 3d; and the three last to the
4th. Of the ten senior tribunes, the two first are assigned to
the 1st legion; the next three to the 2d; the two next to
the 3d; and the three last to the 4th.</p>

<p><a name="b6_20" id="b6_20"><b>20.</b></a> This division and assignment of the tribunes having
been settled in such a way that all four legions have an
equal number of officers, the tribunes of the several legions
take up a separate position and draw lots for the tribes
one by one; and summon the tribe on whom it from time
to time falls. From this tribe they select four young men
as nearly like each other in age and physical strength as
possible. These four are brought forward, and the tribunes
of the first legion picks out one of them, those of the second
another, those of the third another, and the fourth has to
take the last. When the next four are selected the tribunes
of the second legion have the first choice, and those of the first
the last. With the next four the tribunes of the third legion
have the first choice, those of the second the last; and so on
in regular rotation: of which the result is that each legion
gets men of much the same standard. But when they have
selected the number prescribed,&mdash;which is four thousand two
hundred infantry for each legion, or at times of special danger
five thousand,&mdash;they next used to pass men for the cavalry, in
old times <i>after</i> the four thousand two hundred infantry; but
now they do it before them, the selection having been made by
the censor on the basis of wealth; and they enrol three hundred
for each legion.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p><a name="b6_21" id="b6_21"><b>21.</b></a> The roll having been completed in this manner, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>tribunes belonging to the several legions muster their men;
and selecting one of the whole body that they think most
suitable for the purpose, they cause him to take an oath that
he will obey his officers and do their orders to the best of his
ability. And all the others come up and take the oath
separately, merely affirming that they will do the same as the
first man.</p>

<p>At the same time the Consuls send orders to the magistrates
of the allied cities in Italy, from which they determine that
allied troops are to serve: declaring the number required, and
the day and place at which the men selected must appear.
The cities then enrol their troops with much the same
ceremonies as to selection and administration of the oath, and
appoint a commander and a paymaster.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<p>The Military Tribunes at Rome, after the administering
of the oath to their men, and giving out the
day and place at which they are to appear
without arms, <span class="sidenote">Fourfold division
of the
Legionaries.</span>
for the present dismiss them.
When they arrive on the appointed day, they first select the
youngest and poorest to form the <i>Velites</i>, the next to them
the <i>Hastati</i>, while those who are in the prime of life they
select as <i>Principes</i>, and the oldest of all as <i>Triarii</i>. For in
the Roman army these divisions, distinct not only as to their
ages and nomenclature, but also as to the manner in which
they are armed, exist in each legion. The division is made in such
proportions that the senior men, called <i>Triarii</i>, should number
six hundred, the <i>Principes</i> twelve hundred, the <i>Hastati</i> twelve
hundred, and that all the rest as the youngest should be
reckoned among the <i>Velites</i>. And if the whole number of the
legion is more than four thousand, they vary the numbers of
these divisions proportionally, except those of the <i>Triarii</i>,
which is always the same.</p>

<p><a name="b6_22" id="b6_22"><b>22.</b></a> The youngest soldiers or <i>Velites</i> are ordered to
carry a sword, spears, and target (<i>parma</i>). <span class="sidenote">1. Arms of the
<i>Velites</i>.</span>
The
target is strongly made, and large enough to
protect the man; being round, with a diameter
of three feet. Each man also wears a head-piece without a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>crest (<i>galea</i>); which he sometimes covers with a piece of
wolf&#8217;s skin or something of that kind, for the sake both of
protection and identification; that the officers of his company
may be able to observe whether he shows courage or the
reverse on confronting dangers. The spear of the velites has
a wooden haft of about two cubits, and about a finger&#8217;s
breadth in thickness; its head is a span long, hammered fine,
and sharpened to such an extent that it becomes bent the first
time it strikes, and cannot be used by the enemy to hurl
back; otherwise the weapon would be available for both
sides alike.</p>

<p><a name="b6_23" id="b6_23"><b>23.</b></a>The second rank, the <i>Hastati</i>, are ordered to have the
complete panoply. This to a Roman means,
first, a large shield (<i>scutum</i>), <span class="sidenote">2. Arms of the
<i>Hastati</i>, <i>Principes</i>,
and <i>Triarii</i>.</span>
the surface of
which is curved outwards, its breadth two and
a half feet, its length four feet,&mdash;though there is also an extra
sized shield in which these measures are increased by a palm&#8217;s
breadth. It consists of two layers of wood fastened together
with bull&#8217;s-hide glue; the outer surface of which is first
covered with canvas, then with calf&#8217;s skin, on the upper and
lower edges it is bound with iron to resist the downward
strokes of the sword, and the wear of resting upon the ground.
Upon it also is fixed an iron boss (<i>umbo</i>), to resist the more formidable
blows of stones and pikes, and of heavy missiles
generally. With the shield they also carry a sword (<i>gladius</i>)
hanging down by their right thigh, which is called a Spanish
sword.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> It has an excellent point, and can deal a formidable
blow with either edge, because its blade is stout and unbending.
In addition to these they have two <i>pila</i>, a brass helmet, and
greaves (<i>ocreae</i>). Some of the <i>pila</i> are thick, some fine.
Of the thicker, some are round with the diameter of a palm&#8217;s
length, others are a palm square. The fine pila are like
moderate sized hunting spears, and they are carried along with
the former sort. The wooden haft of them all is about three
cubits long; and the iron head fixed to each half is barbed, and
of the same length as the haft. They take extraordinary pains
to attach the head to the haft firmly; they make the fastening
of the one to the other so secure for use by binding it half
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>way up the wood, and riveting it with a series of clasps, that
the iron breaks sooner than this fastening comes loose,
although its thickness at the socket and where it is fastened
to the wood is a finger and a half&#8217;s breadth. Besides these
each man is decorated with a plume of feathers, with three
purple or black feathers standing upright, about a cubit long.
The effect of these being placed on the helmet, combined with
the rest of the armour, is to give the man the appearance of
being twice his real height, and to give him a noble aspect
calculated to strike terror into the enemy. The common
soldiers also receive a brass plate, a span square, which they
put upon their breast and call a breastpiece (<i>pectorale</i>),
and so complete their panoply. Those who are rated above
a hundred thousand asses, instead of these breastpieces
wear, with the rest of their armour, coats of mail (<i>loricae</i>).
The Principes and Triarii are armed in the same way as the
<i>Hastati</i>, except that instead of <i>pila</i> they carry long spears
(<i>hastae</i>).</p>

<p><a name="b6_24" id="b6_24"><b>24.</b></a> The <i>Principes</i>, <i>Hastati</i>, and <i>Triarii</i>, each elect ten
centurions according to merit, and then a
second ten each. <span class="sidenote">Election of
Centurions.</span>
All these sixty have the
title of centurion alike, of whom the first man
chosen is a member of the council of war. And they in
their turn select a rear-rank officer each who is called <i>optio</i>.
Next, in conjunction with the centurions, they divide the
several orders (omitting the <i>Velites</i>) into ten companies each,
and appoint to each company two centurions and two
<i>optiones</i>; the <i>Velites</i> are divided equally among all the companies;
these companies are called orders (<i>ordines</i>) or maniples
(<i>manipuli</i>), or vexilla, and their officers are called centurions or
<i>ordinum ductores</i>.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> Each maniple selects two of their strongest
and best born men as standard-bearers (<i>vexillarii</i>). And that
each maniple should have two commanding officers is only
reasonable; for it being impossible to know what a commander
may be doing or what may happen to him, and necessities of
war admitting of no parleying, they are anxious that the
maniple may never be without a leader and commander.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span></p>
<p>When the two centurions are both on the field, the first elected
commands the right of the maniple, the second the left: if
both are not there, the one who is commands the whole. And
they wish the centurions not to be so much bold and adventurous,
as men with a faculty for command, steady, and of a
profound rather than a showy spirit; not prone to engage
wantonly or be unnecessarily forward in giving battle; but such
as in the face of superior numbers and overwhelming pressure
will die in defence of their post.</p>

<p><a name="b6_25" id="b6_25"><b>25.</b></a> Similarly they divide the cavalry into ten squadrons
(<i>turmae</i>), and from each they select three
officers (<i>decuriones</i>), <span class="sidenote">Officers and arms
of the equites.</span>
who each select a subaltern
(<i>optio</i>). The decurio first elected
commands the squadron, the other two have the rank
of <i>decuriones</i>: a name indeed which applies to all alike. If
the first <i>decurio</i> is not on the field, the second takes command
of the squadron. The armour of the cavalry is very like that
in Greece. In old times they did not wear the lorica, but
fought in their tunics (<i>campestria</i>); the result of which was
that they were prompt and nimble at dismounting and
mounting again with despatch, but were in great danger at
close quarters from the unprotected state of their bodies.
And their lances too were useless in two ways: first because
they were thin, and prevented their taking a good aim; and
before they could get the head fixed in the enemy, the
lances were so shaken by the mere motion of the horse
that they generally broke. Secondly, because, having no
spike at the butt end of their lance, they only had one stroke,
namely that with the spear-head; and if the lance broke, what
was left in their hands was entirely useless. Again they used
to have shields of bull&#8217;s hide, just like those round cakes, with
a knob in the middle which are used at sacrifices, which were
useless at close quarters because they were flexible rather than
firm; and, when their leather shrunk and rotted from the rain,
unserviceable as they were before, they then became entirely
so. Wherefore, as experience showed them the uselessness of
these, they lost no time in changing to the Greek fashion of
arms: the advantages of which were, first, that men were able
to deliver the first stroke of their lance-head with a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
aim and effect, because the shaft from the nature of its construction
was steady and not quivering; and, secondly, that they
were able, by reversing the lance, to use the spike at the butt-end
for a steady and effective blow. And the same may be
said about the Greek shields: for, whether used to ward off
a blow or to thrust against the enemy, they neither give nor
bend. When the Romans learnt these facts about the Greek
arms they were not long in copying them; for no nation has
ever surpassed them in readiness to adopt new fashions from
other people, and to imitate what they see is better in others
than themselves.</p>

<p><a name="b6_26" id="b6_26"><b>26.</b></a> Having made this distribution of their men and
given orders for their being armed, as I have
described, <span class="sidenote">Assembly of the
legions.</span>
the military tribunes dismiss them
to their homes. But when the day has arrived
on which they were all bound by their oath to appear at
the place named by the Consuls (for each Consul generally
appoints a separate place for his own legions, each having
assigned to him two legions and a moiety of the allies), all
whose names were placed on the roll appear without fail: <span class="sidenote">The Socii.</span>
no
excuse being accepted in the case of those
who have taken the oath, except a prohibitory
omen or absolute impossibility. The allies muster along
with the citizens, and are distributed and managed by
the officers appointed by the Consuls, who have the title
of <i>Praefecti sociis</i> and are twelve in number. These officers
select for the Consuls from the whole infantry and cavalry
of the allies such as are most fitted for actual service,
and these are called <i>extraordinarii</i> (which in Greek is
&#7952;&#960;&#8055;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#953;). The whole number of the infantry of the socii
generally equals that of the legions, but the cavalry is treble
that of the citizens. Of these they select a third of the
cavalry, and a fifth of the infantry to serve as <i>extraordinarii</i>.
The rest they divide into two parts, one of which is called the
right, the other the left wing (<i>alae</i>).</p>

<p>These arrangements made, the military tribunes take over
the citizens and allies and proceed to form a camp. Now the
principle on which they construct their camps, no matter when
or where, is the same; I think therefore that it will be in place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
here to try and make my readers understand, as far as words
can do so, the Roman tactics in regard to the march (<i>agmen</i>),
the camp (<i>castrorum metatio</i>), and the line of battle (<i>acies</i>). I
cannot imagine any one so indifferent to things noble and
great, as to refuse to take some little extra trouble to understand
things like these; for if he has once heard them, he will
be acquainted with one of those things genuinely worth observation
and knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="b6_27" id="b6_27"><b>27.</b></a> Their method of laying out a camp is as follows. The
place for the camp having been selected, <span class="sidenote"><i>Castrorum
metatio.</i></span>
the spot in it best calculated to give a view
of the whole, and most convenient for issuing
orders, is appropriated for the general&#8217;s tent (<i>Praetorium</i>).</p>

<p>Having placed a standard on the spot on which they intend
to put the Praetorium, they measure off a square round this
standard, in such a way that each of its sides is a hundred feet
from the standard, and the area of the square is four plethra.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>
Along one side of this square&mdash;whichever aspect appears
most convenient for watering and foraging&mdash;the legions are
stationed as follows. I have said that there were six Tribuni
in each legion, and that each Consul had two legions,&mdash;it
follows that there are twelve <i>Tribuni</i> in a Consular army. Well,
they pitch the tents of these Tribuni all in one straight line,
parallel to the side of the square selected, at a distance of fifty
feet from it (there is a place too selected for the horses,
beasts of burden, and other baggage of the Tribuni); these
tents face the outer side of the camp and away from the square
described above,&mdash;a direction which will henceforth be called
&#8220;the front&#8221; by me. The tents of the Tribuni stand at equal
distances from each other, so that they extend along the whole
breadth of the space occupied by the legions.</p>

<p><a name="b6_28" id="b6_28"><b>28.</b></a> From the line described by the front of these tents
they measure another distance of a hundred
feet towards the front. <span class="sidenote">The principia.</span>
At that distance another
parallel straight line is drawn, and it is from this last that they
begin arranging the quarters of the legions, which they do as
follows:&mdash;they bisect the last mentioned straight line and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
from that point draw another straight line at right angles
to it; along this line, on either side of it facing
each other, <span class="sidenote">The quarters.</span>
the cavalry of the two legions are
quartered with a space of fifty feet between them, which space
is exactly bisected by the line last mentioned. The manner
of encamping the infantry is similar to that of the cavalry.
The whole area of each space occupied by the maniples and
squadrons is a square, and faces the <i>via</i>;<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> the length facing
the <i>via</i> is one hundred feet, and they generally try to make the
depth the same, except in the case of the socii; and when they
are employing legions of an extra number, they increase the
length and depth of these squares proportionally.</p>

<p><a name="b6_29" id="b6_29"><b>29.</b></a> The spaces assigned to the cavalry are opposite the
space between the two groups of tents belonging to the Tribuni
of the two legions, at right angles to the line along which they
stand, like a cross-road; and indeed the whole arrangement
of the <i>viae</i> is like a system of cross-roads, running on either side
of the blocks of tents, those of the cavalry on one side and those
of the infantry on the other. The spaces assigned to the
cavalry and the Triarii in each legion are back to back, with no
<i>via</i> between them, but touching each other, looking opposite
ways; and the depth of the spaces assigned to the Triarii is
only half that assigned to other maniples, because their
numbers are generally only half; but though the number of
the men is different, the length of the space is always the same
owing to the lesser depth. Next, parallel with these spaces, at
a distance of fifty feet, they place the <i>Principes</i> facing the
Triarii; and as they face the space between themselves and
the <i>Triarii</i>, we have two more roads formed at right angles
to the hundred-foot area in front of the tents of the Tribunes,
and running down from it to the outer agger of the camp on the
side opposite to that of the Principia, which we agreed to call
the front of the camp. Behind the spaces for the <i>Triarii</i> and
looking in the opposite direction, and touching each other, are
the spaces for the <i>Hastati</i>. These several branches of the
service (<i>Triarii</i>, <i>Principes</i>, <i>Hastati</i>), being each divided into
ten maniples, the cross-roads between the blocks are all the
same length and terminate in the front agger of the camp;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>towards which they cause the last maniples in the rows to
face.</p>

<p><a name="b6_30" id="b6_30"><b>30.</b></a> Beyond the <i>Hastati</i> they again leave a space of fifty
feet, and there, beginning from the same base (the Principia),
and going in a parallel direction, and to the same distance
as the other blocks, they place the cavalry of the allies facing
the <i>Hastati</i>. Now the number of the allies, as I have stated
above, is equal to that of the legions in regard to the infantry,
though it falls below that if we omit the <i>extraordinarii</i>; but
that of the cavalry is double, when the third part is deducted
for service among the <i>extraordinarii</i>. Therefore in marking
out the camp the spaces assigned to the latter are made proportionally
deeper, so that their length remains the same as
those occupied by the legions. Thus five viae are formed:<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a>
and back to back with these cavalry are the spaces for the
infantry of the allies, the depth being proportionally increased
according to their numbers;<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> and these maniples face the outer
sides of the camp and the agger. In each maniple the first
tent at either end is occupied by the centurions. Between
the fifth and sixth squadrons of cavalry, and the
fifth and sixth maniple of infantry, there is a
space of fifty left, <span class="sidenote">Via Quintana.</span>
so that another road is made across the
camp at right angles to the others and parallel to the tents
of the Tribuni, and this they call the <i>Via Quintana</i>, as it runs
along the fifth squadrons and maniples.</p>

<p><a name="b6_31" id="b6_31"><b>31.</b></a> The space behind the tents of the Tribuni is thus
used. On one side of the square of the Praetorium
is the market, <span class="sidenote">The space between
the Principia and
the agger.</span>
on the other the office of
the Quaestor and the supplies which he has
charge of. Then behind the last tent of the Tribuni on
either side, arranged at right angles to those tents, are the
quarters of the cavalry picked out of the <i>extraordinarii</i>,
as
well as of some of those who are serving as
volunteers from personal friendship to
<span class="sidenote">The Staff, or
Praetoria cohors.</span>Consuls. All these are arranged parallel to
the side aggers, facing on the one side the Quaestorium, on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>the other the market-place. And, generally speaking, it falls
to the lot of these men not only to be near the Consul in the
camp, but to be wholly employed about the persons of the
Consul and the Quaestor on the march and all other occasions.
Back to back with these again, facing the agger, are placed
the infantry who serve in the same way as these cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p>Beyond these there is another empty space or road left,
one hundred feet broad, parallel to the tents of the Tribuni,
skirting the market-place, Praetorium, and Quaestorium, from
agger to agger. On the further side of this road the rest of
the <i>equites extraordinarii</i> are placed facing the market-place
and Quaestorium: and between the quarters of these cavalry
of the two legions a passage is left of fifty feet, exactly opposite
and at right angles to the square of the Praetorium, leading
to the rearward agger.</p>

<p>Back to back with the <i>equites extraordinarii</i> are the infantry
of the same, facing the agger at the rear of the whole camp.
And the space left empty on either side of these, facing the
agger on each side of the camp, is given up to foreigners and
such allies as chance to come to the camp.</p>

<p>The result of these arrangements is that the whole camp is
a square, with streets and other constructions
regularly planned like a town. <span class="sidenote">The space round
the quarters.</span>
Between the line
of the tents and the agger there is an empty space
of two hundred feet on every side of the square, which is turned
to a great variety of uses. To begin with, it is exceedingly convenient
for the marching in and out of the legions. For each
division descends into this space by the <i>via</i> which passes its own
quarters, and so avoids crowding and hustling each other, as
they would if they were all collected on one road. Again, all
cattle brought into the camp, as well as booty of all sorts taken
from the enemy, are deposited in this space and securely
guarded during the night-watches. But the most important
use of this space is that, in night assaults, it secures the tents
from the danger of being set on fire, and keeps the soldiers
out of the range of the enemy&#8217;s missiles; or, if a few of them
do carry so far, they are spent and cannot penetrate the tents.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b6_32" id="b6_32"><b>32.</b></a> The number then of foot-soldiers and cavalry being
given (at the rate, that is to say, of four
thousand or of five thousand for each legion), <span class="sidenote">Provision for
extra numbers,</span>
and the length, depth, and number of the
maniples being likewise known, as well as the breadth of
the passages and roads, it becomes possible to calculate
the area occupied by the camp and the length of the
aggers. If on any occasion the number of allies, either
those originally enrolled or those who joined subsequently,
exceeds their due proportion, the difficulty is provided for
in this way. To the overplus of allies who joined subsequent
to the enrolment of the army are assigned the spaces on either
side of the Praetorium, the market-place and Quaestorium being
proportionally contracted. For the extra numbers of allies
who joined originally an extra line of tents (forming thus another
<i>via</i>) is put up parallel with the other tents of the socii,
facing the agger on either side of the camp. <span class="sidenote">and for two consular
armies.</span>
But if all four
legions and both Consuls are in the same
camp, all we have to do is to imagine a second
army, arranged back to back to the one
already placed, in exactly the same spaces as the former,
but side by side with it at the part where the picked men
from the <i>extraordinarii</i> are stationed facing the rearward agger.
In this case the shape of the camp becomes an oblong, the
area double, and the length of the entire agger half as much
again. This is the arrangement when both Consuls are within
the same agger; but if they occupy two separate camps, the
above arrangements hold good, except that the market-place is
placed half way between the two camps.</p>

<p><a name="b6_33" id="b6_33"><b>33.</b></a> The camp having thus been laid out, the Tribuni
next administer an oath to all in it separately,
whether free or slave, <span class="sidenote">Guard duty.</span>
that they will steal
nothing within the agger, and in case they find anything will
bring it to the Tribuni. They next select for their several
duties the maniples of the Principes and Hastati in each
legion. Two are told off to guard the space in front of the
quarters of the Tribuni. For in this space, which is called the
Principia, most of the Romans in the camp transact all the
business of the day; and are therefore very particular about its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
being kept well watered and properly swept. Of the other
eighteen maniples, three are assigned to each of the six Tribuni,
that being the respective numbers in each legion; and of these
three maniples each takes its turn of duty in waiting upon the
Tribune. The services they render him are such as these:
they pitch his tent for him when a place is selected for
encampment, and level the ground all round it; and if any
extra precaution is required for the protection of his baggage,
it is their duty to see to it. They also supply him with two
relays of guards. A guard consists of four men, two of whom
act as sentries in front of his tent, and two on the rear of it
near the horses. Seeing that each Tribune has three maniples,
and each maniple has a hundred men, without counting <i>Triarii</i>
and <i>Velites</i> who are not liable for this service, the duty is a
light one, coming round to each maniple only once in three
days; while by this arrangement ample provision is made for
the convenience as well as the dignity of the Tribuni. The
maniples of Triarii are exempted from this personal service to
the Tribuni, but they each supply a watch of four men to the
squadron of cavalry nearest them. These watches have to
keep a general look out; but their chief duty is to keep an eye
upon the horses, to prevent their hurting themselves by getting
entangled in their tethers, and so becoming unfit for use; or
from getting loose, and making a confusion and disturbance in
the camp by running against other horses. Finally, all the
maniples take turns to mount guard for a day each at the
Consul&#8217;s tent, to protect him from plots, and maintain the
dignity of his office.</p>

<p><a name="b6_34" id="b6_34"><b>34.</b></a> As to the construction of the foss and vallum,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> two
sides fall to the lot of the socii, each division
taking that side along which it is quartered; <span class="sidenote">Construction of
the <i>fossa</i> and
<i>agger</i>.</span>
the other two are left to the Romans, one
to each legion. Each side is divided into portions according
to the number of maniples, and the centurions stand
by and superintend the work of each maniple; while two
of the Tribunes superintend the construction of the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
side and see that it is adequate. In the same way the
Tribunes superintend all other operations in the camp. They
divide themselves in twos, and each pair is on duty for two
months out of six; they draw lots for their turns, and the pair
on whom the lot falls takes the superintendence of all active
operations. The prefects of the socii divide their duty in the
same way. <span class="sidenote">Orders of the
day.</span>
At daybreak the officers of the
cavalry and the centurions muster at the tents
of the Tribunes, while the Tribunes go to that
of the Consul. He gives the necessary orders to the Tribunes,
they to the cavalry officers and centurions, and these last pass
them on to the rank and file as occasion may demand.</p>

<p>To secure the passing round of the watchword for the
night the following course is followed. One
man is selected from the tenth maniple, <span class="sidenote">The watchword.</span>
which, in the case both of cavalry and infantry, is quartered
at the ends of the road between the tents; this
man is relieved from guard-duty and appears each day
about sunset at the tent of the Tribune on duty, takes the
<i>tessera</i> or wooden tablet on which the watchword is inscribed,
and returns to his own maniple and delivers the wooden tablet
and watchword in the presence of witnesses to the chief
officer of the maniple next his own; he in the same way to
the officer of the next, and so on, until it arrives at the first
maniple stationed next the Tribunes. These men are
obliged to deliver the tablet (<i>tessera</i>) to the Tribunes before
dark. If they are all handed in, the Tribune knows that the
watchword has been delivered to all, and has passed through
all the ranks back to his hands: but if any one is missing, he
at once investigates the matter; for he knows by the marks on
the tablets from which division of the army the tablet has not
appeared; and the man who is discovered to be responsible
for its non-appearance is visited with condign punishment.</p>

<p><a name="b6_35" id="b6_35"><b>35.</b></a> Next as to the keeping guard at night. The
Consul&#8217;s tent is guarded by the maniple
on duty: <span class="sidenote">Night watches.</span>
those of the Tribuni and praefects
of the cavalry by the pickets formed as described above
from the several maniples. And in the same way each
maniple and squadron posts guards of their own men. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
other pickets are posted by the Consul. Generally speaking
there are three pickets at the Quaestorium, and two at the
tent of each of the legati or members of council. The vallum
is lined by the <i>velites</i>, who are on guard all along it from
day to day. That is their special duty; while they also guard
all the entrances to the camp, telling off ten sentinels to take
their turn at each of them. Of the men told off for duty at the
several <i>stationes</i>, the man who in each maniple is to take the
first watch is brought by the rear-rank man of his company to
the Tribune at eventide. The latter hands over to them
severally small wooden tablets (<i>tesserae</i>), one for each watch,
inscribed with small marks; on receiving which they go off to
the places indicated.</p>

<p><a name="b6_36" id="b6_36"><b>36.</b></a> The duty of going the rounds is intrusted to the cavalry.
The first Praefect of cavalry in each legion, early
in the morning, <span class="sidenote">Visiting rounds.</span>
orders one of his rear-rank men
to give notice before breakfast to four young men of his squadron
who are to go the rounds. At evening this same man&#8217;s duty
is to give notice to the Praefect of the next squadron that it is
his turn to provide for going the rounds until next morning.
This officer thereupon takes measures similar to the preceding
one until the next day; and so on throughout the cavalry
squadrons. The four men thus selected by the rear-rank men
from the first squadron, after drawing lots for the watch they
are to take, proceed to the tent of the Tribune on duty, and
receive from him a writing stating the order<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> and the number
of the watches they are to visit. The four then take up their
quarters for the night alongside of the first maniple of
Triarii; for it is the duty of the centurion of this maniple to
see that a bugle is blown at the beginning of every watch.
When the time has arrived, the man to whose lot the first
watch has fallen goes his rounds, taking some of his friends as
witnesses. He walks through the posts assigned, which are
not only those along the vallum and gates, but also the
pickets set by the several maniples and squadrons. If he
find the men of the first watch awake he takes from them their
tessera; but if he find any one of them asleep or absent from
his post, he calls those with him to witness the fact and passes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>on. The same process is repeated by those who go the
rounds during the other watches. The charge of seeing that
the bugle is blown at the beginning of each watch, so that the
right man might visit the right pickets, is as I have said, laid
upon the centurions of the first maniple of Triarii, each one
taking the duty for a day.</p>

<p>Each of these men who have gone the rounds (<i>tessarii</i>) at
daybreak conveys the tesserae to the Tribune on duty. If the
whole number are given in they are dismissed without
question; but if any of them brings a number less than that
of the pickets, an investigation is made by means of the mark
on the tessera, as to which picket he has omitted. Upon this
being ascertained the centurion is summoned; he brings the
men who were on duty, and they are confronted with the
patrol. If the fault is with the men on guard, the patrol
clears himself by producing the witnesses whom he took with
him; for he cannot do so without. If nothing of that sort
happened, the blame recoils upon the patrol.</p>

<p><a name="b6_37" id="b6_37"><b>37.</b></a> Then the Tribunes at once hold a court-martial,
and the man who is found guilty is punished
by the <i>fustuarium</i>; <span class="sidenote">Military punishments:
the <i>fustuarium</i>.</span>
the nature of which is
this. The Tribune takes a cudgel and merely
touches the condemned man; whereupon all the soldiers
fall upon him with cudgels and stones. Generally speaking
men thus punished are killed on the spot; but if
by any chance, after running the gauntlet, they manage
to escape from the camp, they have no hope of ultimately
surviving even so. They may not return to their own country,
nor would any one venture to receive such an one into his
house. Therefore those who have once fallen into this
misfortune are utterly and finally ruined. The same fate
awaits the praefect of the squadron, as well as his rear-rank
man, if they fail to give the necessary order at the proper time,
the latter to the patrols, and the former to the praefect of the
next squadron. The result of the severity and inevitableness
of this punishment is that in the Roman army the night
watches are faultlessly kept. The common soldiers are
amenable to the Tribunes; the Tribunes to the Consuls.
The Tribune is competent to punish a soldier by inflicting a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
fine, distraining his goods, or ordering him to be flogged; so too
the praefects in the case of the socii. The punishment of the
<i>fustuarium</i> is assigned also to any one committing theft in
the camp, or bearing false witness: as also to any one who in
full manhood is detected in shameful immorality: or to any
one who has been thrice punished for the same offence. All
these things are punished as crimes. But such as the following
are reckoned as cowardly and dishonourable in a soldier:&mdash;for
a man to make a false report to the Tribunes of his
valour in order to get reward; or for men who have been
told off to an ambuscade to quit the place assigned them from
fear; and also for a man to throw away any of his arms from
fear, on the actual field of battle. Consequently it sometimes
happens that men confront certain death at their stations, because,
from their fear of the punishment awaiting them at
home, they refuse to quit their post: while others, who have
lost shield or spear or any other arm on the field, throw themselves
upon the foe, in hopes of recovering what they have lost,
or of escaping by death from certain disgrace and the insults
of their relations.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></p>

<p><a name="b6_38" id="b6_38"><b>38.</b></a> But if it ever happens that a number of men are
involved in these same acts: if, for instance, <span class="sidenote">Decimatio.</span>
some entire maniples have quitted their ground
in the presence of the enemy, it is deemed impossible to
subject all to the <i>fustuarium</i> or to military execution;
but a solution of the difficulty has been found at once
adequate to the maintenance of discipline and calculated
to strike terror. The Tribune assembles the legion, calls
the defaulters to the front, and, after administering a sharp
rebuke, selects five or eight or twenty out of them by lot,
so that those selected should be about a tenth of those who
have been guilty of the act of cowardice. These selected
are punished with the <i>fustuarium</i> without mercy; the rest are
put on rations of barley instead of wheat, and are ordered to
take up their quarters outside the vallum and the protection of
the camp. As all are equally in danger of having the lot fall
on them, and as all alike who escape that, are made a conspicuous
example of by having their rations of barley, the best
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>possible means are thus taken to inspire fear for the future,
and to correct the mischief which has actually occurred.</p>

<p><a name="b6_39" id="b6_39"><b>39.</b></a> A very excellent plan also is adopted for inducing
young soldiers to brave danger. <span class="sidenote">Military
decorations.</span>
When an
engagement has taken place and any of them
have showed conspicuous gallantry, the Consul
summons an assembly of the legion, puts forward those
whom he considers to have distinguished themselves in any
way, and first compliments each of them individually on his
gallantry, and mentions any other distinction he may have
earned in the course of his life, and then presents them with
gifts: to the man who has wounded an enemy, a spear; to
the man who has killed one and stripped his armour, a cup,
if he be in the infantry, horse-trappings if in the cavalry:
though originally the only present made was a spear. This
does not take place in the event of their having wounded or
stripped any of the enemy in a set engagement or the storming
of a town; but in skirmishes or other occasions of that
sort, in which, without there being any positive necessity for
them to expose themselves singly to danger, they have done
so voluntarily and deliberately. In the capture of a town
those who are first to mount the walls are presented
with a gold crown. <span class="sidenote">Mural crown.</span>
So too those who
have covered and saved any citizens or allies are distinguished
by the Consul with certain presents; <span class="sidenote">Civic crown.</span>
and those whom they
have preserved present them voluntarily with a
crown, or if not, they are compelled to do so
by the Tribunes. The man thus preserved, too, reverences
his preserver throughout his life as a father, and is bound to
act towards him as a father in every respect. By such incentives
those who stay at home are stirred up to a noble
rivalry and emulation in confronting danger, no less than those
who actually hear and see what takes place. For the recipients
of such rewards not only enjoy great glory among
their comrades in the army, and an immediate reputation at
home, but after their return they are marked men in all
solemn festivals; for they alone, who have been thus distinguished
by the Consuls for bravery, are allowed to wear
robes of honour on those occasions: and moreover they place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
the spoils they have taken in the most conspicuous places in
their houses, as visible tokens and proofs of their valour. No
wonder that a people, whose rewards and punishments are
allotted with such care and received with such feelings, should
be brilliantly successful in war.</p>

<p>The pay of the foot soldier is 5-1/3 asses a day; of the
centurion 10-2/3; of the cavalry 16. The infantry receive a
ration of wheat equal to about 2/3 of an Attic medimnus a
month, and the cavalry 7 medimni of barley, and 2 of wheat;
of the allies the infantry receive the same, the cavalry 1-1/3
medimnus of wheat, and 5 of barley. This is a free gift to
the allies; but in the cases of the Romans, the Quaestor stops
out of their pay the price of their corn and clothes, or any
additional arms they may require at a fixed rate.</p>

<p><a name="b6_40" id="b6_40"><b>40.</b></a> The following is their manner of moving camp. At
the first bugle the men all strike their tents and collect their
baggage; but no soldier may strike his tent, or set it up either,
till the same is done to that of the Tribuni and the Consul.
At the second bugle they load the beasts of burden with their
baggage: at the third the first maniples must advance and
set the whole camp in motion. Generally speaking, the men
appointed to make this start are the <i>extraordinarii</i>: next comes
the right wing of the socii; and behind them their beasts of
burden. These are followed by the first legion with its own
baggage immediately on its rear; then comes the second
legion, followed by its own beasts of burden, and the baggage
of those socii who have to bring up the rear of the march,
that is to say, the left wing of the socii. The cavalry sometimes
ride on the rear of their respective divisions, sometimes
on either side of the beasts of burden, to keep them together
and secure them. If an attack is expected on the rear, the
<i>extraordinarii</i> themselves occupy the rear instead of the
van. Of the two legions and wings each takes the lead in
the march on alternate days, that by this interchange of position
all may have an equal share in the advantage of being
first at the water and forage. The order of march, however,
is different at times of unusual danger, if they have open ground
enough. For in that case they advance in three parallel
columns, consisting of the <i>Hastati</i>, <i>Principes</i>, and <i>Triarii</i>: the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
beasts of burden belonging to the maniples in the van are placed
in front of all, those belonging to the second behind the leading
maniples, and those belonging to the third behind the second
maniples, thus having the baggage and the maniples in alternate
lines. With this order of march, on an alarm being given, the
columns face to the right or left according to the quarter on
which the enemy appears, and get clear of the baggage. So
that in a short space of time, and by one movement, the whole
of the hoplites are in line of battle&mdash;except that sometimes it
is necessary to half-wheel the <i>Hastati</i> also-&#8212;and the baggage
and the rest of the army are in their proper place for safety,
namely, in the rear of the line of combatants.</p>

<p><a name="b6_41" id="b6_41"><b>41.</b></a> When the army on the march is approaching the
place of encampment, a Tribune, and those
of the centurions who have been from time <span class="sidenote">Encampment on
the march.</span>
to time selected for that duty, are sent
forward to survey the place of encampment. Having done
this they proceed first of all to fix upon the place for the Consul&#8217;s
tent (as I have described above), and to determine on
which side of the Praetorium to quarter the legions. Having
decided these points they measure out the Praetorium, then
they draw the straight line along which the tents of the Tribunes
are to be pitched, and then the line parallel to this, beyond
which the quarters of the legions are to begin. In the same
way they draw the lines on the other sides of the Praetorium
in accordance with the plan which I have already detailed at
length. This does not take long, nor is the marking out of
the camp a matter of difficulty, because the dimensions are all
regularly laid down, and are in accordance with precedent.
Then they fix one flag in the ground where the Consul&#8217;s tent
is to stand, and another on the base of the square containing
it, and a third on the line of the Tribunes&#8217; tents; the two latter
are scarlet, that which marks the Consul&#8217;s tent is white; the
lines on the other sides of the Praetorium are marked sometimes
with plain spears and sometimes by flags of other colours.
After this they lay out the <i>viae</i> between the quarters, fixing
spears at each <i>via</i>. Consequently when the legions in the
course of their march have come near enough to get a clear
view of the place of encampment, they can all make out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
exactly the whole plan of it, taking as their base the Consul&#8217;s
flag and calculating from that. Moreover as each soldier
knows precisely on which <i>via</i>, and at what point of it, his
quarters are to be, because all occupy the same position in
the camp wherever it may be, it is exactly like a legion entering
its own city; when breaking off at the gates each man makes
straight for his own residence without hesitation, because he
knows the direction and the quarter of the town in which
home lies. It is precisely the same in a Roman camp.</p>

<p><a name="b6_42" id="b6_42"><b>42.</b></a> It is because the first object of the Romans in the
matter of encampment is facility, that they seem to me to
differ diametrically from Greek military men in this respect.
Greeks, in choosing a place for a camp, think primarily of
security from the natural strength of the position: first, because
they are averse from the toil of digging a foss, and, secondly,
because they think that no artificial defences are comparable
to those afforded by the nature of the ground. Accordingly,
they not only have to vary the whole configuration of the camp
to suit the nature of the ground, but to change the arrangement
of details in all kinds of irregular ways; so that neither
soldier nor company has a fixed place in it. The Romans, on
the other hand, prefer to undergo the fatigue of digging, and
of the other labours of circumvallation, for the sake of the
facility in arrangement, and to secure a plan of encampment
which shall be one and the same and familiar to all.</p>

<p>Such are the most important facts in regard to the legions
and the method of encamping them....</p>

<h3>THE ROMAN REPUBLIC COMPARED WITH OTHERS</h3>

<p><a name="b6_43" id="b6_43"><b>43.</b></a> Nearly all historians have recorded as constitutions
of eminent excellence those of Lacedaemonia,
Crete, Mantinea, and Carthage. <span class="sidenote">The Theban constitution
may be
put aside,</span>
Some have
also mentioned those of Athens and Thebes.
The former I may allow to pass; but I am convinced that
little need be said of the Athenian and Theban constitutions:
their growth was abnormal, the period of their
zenith brief, and the changes they experienced unusually
violent. Their glory was a sudden and fortuitous flash, so to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
speak; and while they still thought themselves prosperous, and
likely to remain so, they found themselves involved in
circumstances completely the reverse. The Thebans got their
reputation for valour among the Greeks, by taking advantage
of the senseless policy of the Lacedaemonians, and the hatred
of the allies towards them, owing to the valour of one, or at
most two, men who were wise enough to appreciate the
situation. Since fortune quickly made it evident that it was
not the peculiarity of their constitution, but the valour of
their leaders, which gave the Thebans their success. For the
great power of Thebes notoriously took its rise, attained its
zenith, and fell to the ground with the lives of Epaminondas
and Pelopidas. We must therefore conclude that it was not
its constitution, but its men, that caused the high fortune
which it then enjoyed.</p>

<p><a name="b6_44" id="b6_44"><b>44.</b></a> A somewhat similar remark applies to the Athenian
constitution also. For though it perhaps had
more frequent interludes of excellence, <span class="sidenote">as also the
Athenian.</span>yet
its highest perfection was attained during the
brilliant career of Themistocles; and having reached that
point it quickly declined, owing to its essential instability.
For the Athenian demus is always in the position of a ship
without a commander. In such a ship, if fear of the enemy,
or the occurrence of a storm induce the crew to be of one mind
and to obey the helmsman, everything goes well; but if they
recover from this fear, and begin to treat their officers with
contempt, and to quarrel with each other because they are no
longer all of one mind,&mdash;one party wishing to continue the
voyage, and the other urging the steersman to bring the ship
to anchor; some letting out the sheets, and others hauling
them in, and ordering the sails to be furled,-&#8212;their discord and
quarrels make a sorry show to lookers on; and the position of
affairs is full of risk to those on board engaged on the same
voyage: and the result has often been that, after escaping the
dangers of the widest seas, and the most violent storms, they
wreck their ship in harbour and close to shore. And this is what
has often happened to the Athenian constitution. For, after
repelling, on various occasions, the greatest and most formidable
dangers by the valour of its people and their leaders, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
have been times when, in periods of secure tranquillity, it has
gratuitously and recklessly encountered disaster.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> Therefore I
need say no more about either it, or the Theban constitution: in
both of which a mob manages everything on its own unfettered
impulse&mdash;a mob in the one city distinguished for headlong outbursts
of fiery temper, in the other trained in long habits of
violence and ferocity.</p>

<p><a name="b6_45" id="b6_45"><b>45.</b></a> Passing to the Cretan polity there are two points
which deserve our consideration. The first
is how such writers as Ephorus, <span class="sidenote">The Spartan
polity unlike
that of Crete.</span>Xenophon,
Callisthenes and Plato<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a>&mdash;who are the most
learned of the ancients&mdash;could assert that it was like that
of Sparta; and secondly how they came to assert that it was
at all admirable. I can agree with neither assertion; and
I will explain why I say so. And first as to its dissimilarity
with the Spartan constitution. The peculiar merit of the latter
is said to be its land laws, by which no one possesses more than
another, but all citizens have an equal share in the public
land.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> The next distinctive feature regards the possession of
money: for as it is utterly discredited among them, the
jealous competition which arises from inequality of wealth is
entirely removed from the city. A third peculiarity of the
Lacedaemonian polity is that, of the officials by whose hands
and with whose advice the whole government is conducted,
the kings hold an hereditary office, while the members of the
Gerusia are elected for life.</p>

<p><a name="b6_46" id="b6_46"><b>46.</b></a> Among the Cretans the exact reverse of all these arrangements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
obtains. The laws allow them to possess as much land
as they can get with no limitation whatever. Money is so
highly valued among them, that its possession is not only
thought to be necessary but in the highest degree creditable.
And in fact greed and avarice are so native to the soil in
Crete, that they are the only people in the world among whom
no stigma attaches to any sort of gain whatever. Again all
their offices are annual and on a democratical footing. I have
therefore often felt at a loss to account for these writers
speaking of the two constitutions, which are radically different,
as though they were closely united and allied. But, besides
overlooking these important differences, these writers have
gone out of their way to comment at length on the legislation
of Lycurgus: &#8220;He was the only legislator,&#8221; they say, &#8220;who
saw the important points. For there being two things on
which the safety of a commonwealth depends,&mdash;courage in
the face of the enemy and concord at home,&mdash;by abolishing
covetousness, he with it removed all motive for civil broil and
contest: whence it has been brought about that the Lacedaemonians
are the best governed and most united people in
Greece.&#8221; Yet while giving utterance to these sentiments, and
though they see that, in contrast to this, the Cretans by their
ingrained avarice are engaged in countless public and private
seditions, murders and civil wars, they yet regard these facts as
not affecting their contention, but are bold enough to speak of
the two constitutions as alike. Ephorus, indeed, putting aside
names, employs expressions so precisely the same, when discoursing
on the two constitutions, that, unless one noticed the
proper names, there would be no means whatever of distinguishing
which of the two he was describing.</p>

<p><a name="b6_47" id="b6_47"><b>47.</b></a> In what the difference between them consists I have
already stated. I will now address myself to showing that the
Cretan constitution deserves neither praise nor imitation.</p>

<p>To my mind, then, there are two things fundamental
to every state, in virtue of which its powers
and constitution become desirable or objectionable. <span class="sidenote">Tests of a
good polity.</span>
These are customs and laws.
Of these the desirable are those which make men&#8217;s private
lives holy and pure, and the public character of the state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
civilised and just. The objectionable are those whose effect
is the reverse. As, then, when we see good customs
and good laws prevailing among certain people, we confidently
assume that, in consequence of them, the men and
their civil constitution will be good also, so when we see
private life full of covetousness, and public policy of injustice,
plainly we have reason for asserting their laws, particular customs,
and general constitution to be bad. Now, with few exceptions,
you could find no habits prevailing in private life more
steeped in treachery than those in Crete, and no public policy
more inequitable. Holding, then, the Cretan constitution to
be neither like the Spartan, nor worthy of choice or imitation,
I reject it from the comparison which I have instituted.</p>

<p>Nor again would it be fair to introduce the Republic
of Plato, which is also spoken of in high
terms by some Philosophers. <span class="sidenote">Ideal polities may
be omitted.</span>
For just as we
refuse admission to the athletic contests
to those actors or athletes who have not acquired a
recognised position<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> or trained for them, so we ought not to
admit this Platonic constitution to the contest for the prize
of merit unless it can first point to some genuine and practical
achievement. Up to this time the notion of bringing it into
comparison with the constitutions of Sparta, Rome, and Carthage
would be like putting up a statue to compare with living
and breathing men. Even if such a statue were faultless in
point of art, the comparison of the lifeless with the living
would naturally leave an impression of imperfection and incongruity
upon the minds of the spectators.</p>

<p><a name="b6_48" id="b6_48"><b>48.</b></a> I shall therefore omit these, and proceed with my
description of the Laconian constitution. <span class="sidenote">The aims of
Lycurgus.</span>
Now
it seems to me that for securing unity among
the citizens, for safe-guarding the Laconian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>territory, and preserving the liberty of Sparta inviolate,
the legislation and provisions of Lycurgus were so excellent,
that I am forced to regard his wisdom as something
superhuman. For the equality of landed possessions, the
simplicity in their food, and the practice of taking it in common,
which he established, were well calculated to secure morality
in private life and to prevent civil broils in the State; as also
their training in the endurance of labours and dangers to make
men brave and noble minded: but when both these virtues,
courage and high morality, are combined in one soul or in one
state, vice will not readily spring from such a soil, nor will
such men easily be overcome by their enemies. By constructing
his constitution therefore in this spirit, and of these
elements, he secured two blessings to the Spartans,&mdash;safety for
their territory, and a lasting freedom for themselves long after he
was gone. He appears however to have made no one provision
whatever, particular or general, for the acquisition of the territory
of their neighbours; or for the assertion of their supremacy; or,
in a word, for any policy of aggrandisement at all. What he
had still to do was to impose such a necessity, or create such a
spirit among the citizens, that, as he had succeeded in making
their individual lives independent and simple, the public
character of the state should also become independent and
moral. <span class="sidenote">Their partial
failure.</span>
But the actual fact is, that, though he made them the
most disinterested and sober-minded men in
the world, as far as their own ways of life and
their national institutions were concerned, he
left them in regard to the rest of Greece ambitious, eager for
supremacy, and encroaching in the highest degree.</p>

<p><a name="b6_49" id="b6_49"><b>49.</b></a> For in the first place is it not notorious that they
were nearly the first Greeks to cast a covetous
eye upon the territory of their neighbours, <span class="sidenote">First and second
Messenian wars,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;745-724 (?),
685-668.</span>
and that accordingly they waged a
war of subjugation on the Messenians?
In the next place is it not related in all histories that in
their dogged obstinacy they bound themselves with an oath
never to desist from the siege of Messene until they
had taken it? And lastly it is known to all that in their
efforts for supremacy in Greece they submitted to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
the bidding of those whom they had once conquered in
war. For when the Persians invaded Greece,
they conquered them, <span class="sidenote">Battle of Plataea,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;479.</span>as champions of the
liberty of the Greeks; yet when the invaders
had retired and fled, they betrayed the cities of Greece into
their hands by the peace of Antalcidas, <span class="sidenote">Peace of
Antalcidas,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;387.</span>for the
sake of getting money to secure their supremacy
over the Greeks.
It was then that the defect
in their constitution was rendered apparent. For as long as
their ambition was confined to governing their
immediate neighbours, or even the Peloponnesians
only, they were content with the
<span class="sidenote">The causes of
this failure.</span>resources and supplies provided by Laconia itself, having all
material of war ready to hand, and being able without much
expenditure of time to return home or convey provisions with
them. But directly they took in hand to despatch naval
expeditions, or to go on campaigns by land outside the Peloponnese,
it was evident that neither their iron currency, nor
their use of crops for payment in kind, would be able to
supply them with what they lacked if they abided by the
legislation of Lycurgus; for such undertakings required money
universally current, and goods from foreign countries. Thus
they were compelled to wait humbly at Persian doors, impose
tribute on the islanders, and exact contributions from all the
Greeks: knowing that, if they abided by the laws of Lycurgus,
it was impossible to advance any claims upon any outside power
at all, much less upon the supremacy in Greece.</p>

<p><a name="b6_50" id="b6_50"><b>50.</b></a> My object, then, in this digression is to make it
manifest by actual facts that, for guarding
their own country with absolute safety, <span class="sidenote">Sparta fails where
Rome succeeds.</span>
and
for preserving their own freedom, the legislation
of Lycurgus was entirely sufficient; and for those who
are content with these objects we must concede that there
neither exists, nor ever has existed, a constitution and civil order
preferable to that of Sparta. But if any one is seeking
aggrandisement, and believes that to be a leader and ruler and
despot of numerous subjects, and to have all looking and
turning to him, is a finer thing than that,&mdash;in this point of
view we must acknowledge that the Spartan constitution is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
deficient, and that of Rome superior and better constituted for
obtaining power. And this has been proved by actual facts.
For when the Lacedaemonians strove to possess themselves of
the supremacy in Greece, it was not long before they brought
their own freedom itself into danger. Whereas the Romans,
after obtaining supreme power over the Italians themselves, soon
brought the whole world under their rule,&mdash;in which achievement
the abundance and availability of their supplies largely
contributed to their success.</p>

<p><a name="b6_51" id="b6_51"><b>51.</b></a> Now the Carthaginian constitution seems to me
originally to have been well contrived in
these most distinctively important particulars. <span class="sidenote">Rome fresher
than Carthage;</span>
For they had kings,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> and the Gerusia
had the powers of an aristocracy, and the multitude were
supreme in such things as affected them; and on the whole
the adjustment of its several parts was very like that of Rome
and Sparta. But about the period of its entering on the
Hannibalian war the political state of Carthage was on the
decline,<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> that of Rome improving. For whereas there is in
every body, or polity, or business a natural stage of growth,
zenith, and decay; and whereas everything in them is at its
best at the zenith; we may thereby judge of the difference between
these two constitutions as they existed at that period.
For exactly so far as the strength and prosperity of Carthage
preceded that of Rome in point of time, by so much was
Carthage then past its prime, while Rome was exactly at its
zenith, as far as its political constitution was concerned. In
Carthage therefore the influence of the people in the policy
of the state had already risen to be supreme, while at Rome
the Senate was at the height of its power: and so, as in the
one measures were deliberated upon by the many, in the
other by the best men, the policy of the Romans in
all public undertakings proved the stronger; on which
account, though they met with capital disasters, by force of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>prudent counsels they finally conquered the Carthaginians in
the war.</p>

<p><a name="b6_52" id="b6_52"><b>52.</b></a> If we look however at separate details, for instance
at the provisions for carrying on a war, <span class="sidenote">and its citizen
levies superior
to Carthaginian
mercenaries.</span>
we
shall find that whereas for a naval expedition
the Carthaginians are the better trained and
prepared,&mdash;as it is only natural with a people
with whom it has been hereditary for many generations to
practise this craft, and to follow the seaman&#8217;s trade above all
nations in the world,&mdash;yet, in regard to military service on
land, the Romans train themselves to a much higher pitch
than the Carthaginians. The former bestow their whole
attention upon this department: whereas the Carthaginians
wholly neglect their infantry, though they do take some slight
interest in the cavalry. The reason of this is that they employ
foreign mercenaries, the Romans native and citizen levies. It
is in this point that the latter polity is preferable to the
former. They have their hopes of freedom ever resting on the
courage of mercenary troops: the Romans on the valour of their
own citizens and the aid of their allies. The result is that even
if the Romans have suffered a defeat at first, they renew the war
with undiminished forces, which the Carthaginians cannot do.
For, as the Romans are fighting for country and children, it is
impossible for them to relax the fury of their struggle; but
they persist with obstinate resolution until they have overcome
their enemies. What has happened in regard to their
navy is an instance in point. In skill the Romans are much
behind the Carthaginians, as I have already said; yet the upshot
of the whole naval war has been a decided triumph for
the Romans, owing to the valour of their men. For although
nautical science contributes largely to success in sea-fights,
still it is the courage of the marines that turns the scale most
decisively in favour of victory. The fact is that Italians as a
nation are by nature superior to Phoenicians and Libyans both
in physical strength and courage; but still their habits also do
much to inspire the youth with enthusiasm for such exploits.
One example will be sufficient of the pains taken by the
Roman state to turn out men ready to endure anything to win
a reputation in their country for valour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b6_53" id="b6_53"><b>53.</b></a> Whenever one of their illustrious men dies, in the
course of his funeral, <span class="sidenote">Laudations at
funerals.</span>
the body with all its
paraphernalia is carried into the forum to the
Rostra, as a raised platform there is called,
and sometimes is propped upright upon it so as to be
conspicuous, or, more rarely, is laid upon it. Then with all
the people standing round, his son, if he has left one of full
age and he is there, or, failing him, one of his relations, mounts
the Rostra and delivers a speech concerning the virtues of the
deceased, and the successful exploits performed by him in his
lifetime. By these means the people are reminded of what
has been done, and made to see it with their own eyes,&mdash;not
only such as were engaged in the actual <span class="sidenote">Imagines.</span>
transactions but those also who were not;&mdash;and
their sympathies are so deeply moved, that the loss
appears not to be confined to the actual mourners, but to be
a public one affecting the whole people. After the burial
and all the usual ceremonies have been performed, they place
the likeness of the deceased in the most conspicuous spot in
his house, surmounted by a wooden canopy or shrine. This
likeness consists of a mask made to represent the deceased
with extraordinary fidelity both in shape and colour. These
likenesses they display at public sacrifices adorned with much
care. And when any illustrious member of the family dies,
they carry these masks to the funeral, putting them on men
whom they thought as like the originals as possible in height
and other personal peculiarities. And these substitutes assume
clothes according to the rank of the person represented: <span class="sidenote">Toga praetexta,
purpurea,
picta.</span>if he
was a consul or praetor, a toga with purple
stripes; if a censor, whole purple;<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> if he had also
celebrated a triumph or performed any exploit
of that kind, a toga embroidered with gold.
These representatives also ride themselves in chariots, while
the fasces and axes, and all the other customary insignia of the
particular offices, lead the way, according to the dignity of the
rank in the state enjoyed by the deceased in his lifetime; <span class="sidenote">Sellae curules.</span>
and on arriving at the Rostra they all take
their seats on ivory chairs in their order.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span></p>
<p>There could not easily be a more inspiring spectacle than this
for a young man of noble ambitions and virtuous aspirations.
For can we conceive any one to be unmoved at the sight of
all the likenesses collected together of the men who have
earned glory, all as it were living and breathing? Or what
could be a more glorious spectacle?</p>

<p><a name="b6_54" id="b6_54"><b>54.</b></a> Besides the speaker over the body about to be buried,
after having finished the panegyric of this
particular person, <span class="sidenote">Devotion of the
citizens.</span>
starts upon the others whose
representatives are present, beginning with the
most ancient, and recounts the successes and achievements
of each. By this means the glorious memory of brave
men is continually renewed; the fame of those who have
performed any noble deed is never allowed to die; and the
renown of those who have done good service to their country
becomes a matter of common knowledge to the multitude,
and part of the heritage of posterity. But the chief benefit of
the ceremony is that it inspires young men to shrink from no
exertion for the general welfare, in the hope of obtaining the
glory which awaits the brave. And what I say is confirmed
by this fact. Many Romans have volunteered to decide a
whole battle by single combat; not a few have deliberately
accepted certain death, some in time of war to secure the
safety of the rest, some in time of peace to preserve the safety
of the commonwealth. There have also been instances of
men in office putting their own sons to death, in defiance of
every custom and law, because they rated the interests of
their country higher than those of natural ties even with their
nearest and dearest. There are many stories of this kind,
related of many men in Roman history; but one will be
enough for our present purpose; and I will give the name as
an instance to prove the truth of my words.</p>

<p><a name="b6_55" id="b6_55"><b>55.</b></a> The story goes that Horatius Cocles, while fighting
with two enemies at the head of the bridge <span class="sidenote">Horatius
Cocles.</span>
over the Tiber, which is the entrance to the
city on the north, seeing a large body of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>men advancing to support his enemies, and fearing that
they would force their way into the city, turned round, and
shouted to those behind him to hasten back to the other
side and break down the bridge. They obeyed him: and
whilst they were breaking the bridge, he remained at his
post receiving numerous wounds, and checked the progress
of the enemy: his opponents being panic stricken, not so much
by his strength as by the audacity with which he held his
ground. When the bridge had been broken down, the attack
of the enemy was stopped; and Cocles then threw himself into
the river with his armour on and deliberately sacrificed his
life, because he valued the safety of his country and his own
future reputation more highly than his present life, and the
years of existence that remained to him.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> Such is the
enthusiasm and emulation for noble deeds that are engendered
among the Romans by their customs.</p>

<p><a name="b6_56" id="b6_56"><b>56.</b></a> Again the Roman customs and principles regarding
money transactions are better than those of
the Carthaginians. <span class="sidenote">Purity of
election.</span>
In the view of the latter
nothing is disgraceful that makes for gain;
with the former nothing is more disgraceful than to receive
bribes and to make profit by improper means. For they
regard wealth obtained from unlawful transactions to be as
much a subject of reproach, as a fair profit from the most
unquestioned source is of commendation. A proof of the fact
is this. The Carthaginians obtain office by open bribery, but
among the Romans the penalty for it is death. <span class="sidenote">Cf. ch. 14.</span>
With such a radical difference, therefore, between
the rewards offered to virtue among the two peoples, it is natural
that the ways adopted for obtaining them should be different also.</p>

<p>But the most important difference for the better which
the Roman commonwealth appears to me to
display is in their religious beliefs. <span class="sidenote">Regard to
religion.</span>
For I
conceive that what in other nations is looked
upon as a reproach, I mean a scrupulous fear of the gods, is
the very thing which keeps the Roman commonwealth together.
To such an extraordinary height is this carried among them,
both in private and public business, that nothing could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>exceed it. Many people might think this unaccountable; but
in my opinion their object is to use it as a check upon the
common people. If it were possible to form a state wholly of
philosophers, such a custom would perhaps be unnecessary.
But seeing that every multitude is fickle, and full of lawless
desires, unreasoning anger, and violent passion, the only
resource is to keep them in check by mysterious terrors and
scenic effects of this sort. Wherefore, to my mind, the ancients
were not acting without purpose or at random, when they
brought in among the vulgar those opinions about the gods,
and the belief in the punishments in Hades: much rather do
I think that men nowadays are acting rashly and foolishly in
rejecting them. This is the reason why, apart from anything
else, Greek statesmen, if entrusted with a single talent, though
protected by ten checking-clerks, as many seals, and twice as
many witnesses, yet cannot be induced to keep faith: whereas
among the Romans, in their magistracies and embassies, men
have the handling of a great amount of money, and yet from
pure respect to their oath keep their faith intact. And, again,
in other nations it is a rare thing to find a man who keeps his
hands out of the public purse, and is entirely pure in such
matters: but among the Romans it is a rare thing to detect a
man in the act of committing such a crime.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a>...</p>

<h3>RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION</h3>

<p><a name="b6_57" id="b6_57"><b>57.</b></a> That to all things, then, which exist there is ordained
decay and change I think requires no further arguments to
show: for the inexorable course of nature is sufficient to
convince us of it.</p>

<p>But in all polities we observe two sources of decay existing
from natural causes, the one external, the other internal and
self-produced. The external admits of no certain or fixed
definition, but the internal follows a definite order. What
kind of polity, then, comes naturally first, and what second, I
have already stated in such a way, that those who are capable
of taking in the whole drift of my argument can henceforth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>draw their own conclusions as to the future of the Roman
polity. For it is quite clear, in my opinion. When a commonwealth,
after warding off many great dangers, has arrived at a
high pitch of prosperity and undisputed power, it is evident
that, by the lengthened continuance of great wealth within it,
the manner of life of its citizens will become more extravagant;
and that the rivalry for office, and in other spheres of activity, will
become fiercer than it ought to be. And as this state of things
goes on more and more, the desire of office and the shame of
losing reputation, as well as the ostentation and extravagance
of living, will prove the beginning of a deterioration. And of
this change the people will be credited with being the authors,
when they become convinced that they are being cheated by
some from avarice, and are puffed up with flattery by others from
love of office. For when that comes about, in their passionate
resentment and acting under the dictates of anger, they will
refuse to obey any longer, or to be content with having equal
powers with their leaders, but will demand to have all or far
the greatest themselves. And when that comes to pass the
constitution will receive a new name, which sounds better than
any other in the world, liberty or democracy; but, in fact, it
will become that worst of all governments, mob-rule.</p>

<p>With this description of the formation, growth, zenith, and
present state of the Roman polity, and having discussed also
its difference, for better and worse, from other polities, I will
now at length bring my essay on it to an end.</p>

<p><a name="b6_58" id="b6_58"><b>58.</b></a> Resuming my history from the point at which I started
on this digression I will briefly refer to one transaction, that
I may give a practical illustration of the perfection and power
of the Roman polity at that period, as though I were producing
one of his works as a specimen of the skill of a good artist.</p>

<p>When Hannibal, after conquering the Romans in the battle at
Cannae, got possession of the eight thousand who
were guarding the Roman camp, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216.
Hannibal offers to
put the prisoners
at Cannae to
ransom.</span>
he made them
all prisoners of war, and granted them permission
to send messages to their relations that they might
be ransomed and return home. They accordingly
selected ten of their chief men, whom Hannibal allowed
to depart after binding them with an oath to return. But one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
of them, just as he had got outside the palisade of the camp,
saying that he had forgotten something, went back; and, having
got what he had left behind, once more set out, under the belief
that by means of this return he had kept his promise and discharged
his oath. Upon the arrival of the envoys at Rome,
imploring and beseeching the Senate not to grudge the captured
troops their return home, but to allow them to rejoin their
friends by paying three minae each for them,&mdash;for these were
the terms, they said, granted by Hannibal,&mdash;and declaring that
the men deserved redemption, for they had neither played the
coward in the field, nor done anything unworthy of Rome,
but had been left behind to guard the camp; and that, when
all the rest had perished, they had yielded to absolute necessity
in surrendering to Hannibal: though the Romans had
been severely defeated in the battles, and though they were at
the time deprived of, roughly speaking, all their allies, they
neither yielded so far to misfortune as to disregard what was
becoming to themselves, nor omitted to take into account
any necessary consideration. They saw through Hannibal&#8217;s
purpose in thus acting,&mdash;which was at once to get a large supply
of money, and at the same time to take away all enthusiasm
from the troops opposed to him, by showing that even the
conquered had a hope of getting safe home again. Therefore
the Senate, far from acceding to the request, refused all pity
even to their own relations, and disregarded the services to be
expected from these men in the future: and thus frustrated
Hannibal&#8217;s calculations, and the hopes which he had founded
on these prisoners, by refusing to ransom them; and at the
same time established the rule for their own men, that they
must either conquer or die on the field, as there was no other
hope of safety for them if they were beaten. With this answer
they dismissed the nine envoys who returned of their own
accord; but the tenth who had put the cunning trick in
practice for discharging himself of his oath they put in chains
and delivered to the enemy. So that Hannibal was not so
much rejoiced at his victory in the battle, as struck with
astonishment at the unshaken firmness and lofty spirit displayed
in the resolutions of these senators.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<h3>CAPUA AND PETELIA</h3>

luxury and extravagance surpassing even the common
report about Croton and Sybaris. Being
then unable to support their burden of prosperity
they called in Hannibal; and were accordingly treated with great
severity by Rome. But the people of Petelia maintained their
loyalty to Rome and held out so obstinately, when besieged by
Hannibal, that after having eaten all the leather in the town, and
the bark of all the trees in it, and having stood the siege for
eleven months, as no one came to their relief, they surrendered
with the entire approval of the Romans.... But Capua by its
influence drew over the other cities to the Carthaginians....</p>

<h3>HIERONYMUS OF SYRACUSE</h3>

<p><a name="b7_2" id="b7_2"><b>2.</b></a> After the plot against Hieronymus, King of Syracuse,
Thraso having departed, <span class="sidenote">Hieronymus succeeded
his grandfather
Hiero II. in
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216. Under
the influence of
his uncles,
Zoippus and
Andranodorus,
members of the
Council of 15
established by
Hiero,
Hieronymus
opens communications
with
Hannibal.</span>
Zoippus and Andranodorus
persuaded Hieronymus to lose no time in
sending ambassadors to Hannibal. He accordingly
selected Polycleitus of Cyrene and Philodemus
of Argos for the purpose, and sent them
into Italy, with a commission to discuss the
subject of an alliance with the Carthaginians;
and at the same time he sent his brothers to
Alexandria. Hannibal received Polycleitus and
Philodemus with warmth; held out great prospects
to the young king; and sent the ambassadors
back without delay, accompanied by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
the commander of his triremes, a Carthaginian also named
Hannibal, and the Syracusan Hippocrates and his younger
brother Epicydes. These men had been for some time
serving in Hannibal&#8217;s army, being domiciled at Carthage,
owing to their grandfather having been banished from Syracuse
because he was believed to have assassinated Agatharchus,
one of the sons of Agathocles. On the arrival of these
commissioners at Syracuse, Polycleitus and his colleague
reported the result of their embassy, and the Carthaginian
delivered the message given by Hannibal: <span class="sidenote">Commissioners
sent to Carthage
to formulate a
treaty of alliance.</span>
whereupon the king
without hesitation expressed his willingness to
make a treaty with the Carthaginians; and,
begging the Hannibal who had come to him
to go with all speed to Carthage, promised that
he also would send commissioners from his own court, to
settle matters with the Carthaginians.</p>

<p><a name="b7_3" id="b7_3"><b>3.</b></a> Meanwhile intelligence of this transaction had reached
the Roman praetor at Lilybaeum, who immediately
despatched legates to Hieronymus, <span class="sidenote">The Roman
praetor sends to
remonstrate. A
scene with the
king.</span>
to
renew the treaty which had been made with his
ancestors. Being thoroughly annoyed with this
embassy, Hieronymus said that &#8220;He was sorry
for the Romans that they had come to such utter and shameful
grief<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> in the battles in Italy at the hands of the Carthaginians.&#8221;
The legates were overpowered by the rudeness of
the answer: still they proceeded to ask him, &#8220;Who said
such things about them?&#8221; Whereupon the king pointed
to the Carthaginian envoys who were there, and said, &#8220;You
had better convict them, if they have really been telling
me lies?&#8221; The Roman legates answered that it was not
their habit to take the word of enemies: and advised him
to do nothing in violation of the existing treaty; for that
would be at once equitable and the best thing for himself.
To this the king answered that he would take time to consider
of it, and tell them his decision another time; but he proceeded
to ask them, &#8220;How it came about that before his grandfather&#8217;s
death a squadron of fifty Roman ships had sailed as far as
Pachynus and then gone back again.&#8221; The fact was that a short
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>time ago the Romans had heard that Hiero was dead; and being
much alarmed lest people in Syracuse, despising the youth of
the grandson whom he left, should stir up a revolution, they
had made this cruise with the intention of being ready there
to assist his youthful weakness, and to help in maintaining his
authority; but being informed that his grandfather was still
alive, they sailed back again. When the ambassadors had
stated these facts, the young king answered again, &#8220;Then
please to allow me too now, O Romans, to maintain my
authority by &#8217;sailing back&#8217; to see what I can get from
Carthage.&#8221; The Roman legates perceiving the warmth
with which the king was engaging in his policy, said nothing
at the time; but returned and informed the praetor who had
sent them of what had been said. From that time forward,
therefore, the Romans kept a careful watch upon him as an
enemy.</p>

<p><a name="b7_4" id="b7_4"><b>4.</b></a> Hieronymus on his part selected Agatharchus, Onesimus,
and Hipposthenes to send with Hannibal to
Carthage, <span class="sidenote">The treaty with
Carthage.</span>
with instructions to make an alliance
on the following terms: &#8220;The Carthaginians to
assist him with land and sea forces, in expelling the Romans
from Sicily, and then divide the island with him; so as to have
the river Himera, which divides Sicily almost exactly in half, as
the boundary between the two provinces.&#8221; The commissioners
arrived in Carthage: and finding, on coming to a conference,
that the Carthaginians were prepared to meet them in every
point, they completed the arrangement. Meanwhile Hippocrates
got the young Hieronymus entirely into his hands: and at first
fired his imagination by telling him of Hannibal&#8217;s marches
and pitched battles in Italy; and afterwards by repeating to
him that no one had a better right to the government of all
Siceliots than he; in the first place as the son of Nereis
daughter of Pyrrhus, the only man whom all Siceliots alike
had accepted deliberately and with full assent as their leader
and king; and in the second place in virtue of his grandfather
Hiero&#8217;s sovereign rights. At last he and his brother so won
upon the young man by their conversation, that he would
attend to no one else at all: partly from the natural feebleness
of his character, but still more from the ambitious feelings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
which they had excited in him. And therefore, just when
Agatharchus and his colleagues were completing <span class="sidenote">The king&#8217;s pretensions
rise, and
a new arrangement
is made
with Carthage.</span>
the business on which they had been sent in
Carthage, he sent fresh ambassadors, saying that
all Sicily belonged to him; and demanding that
the Carthaginians should help him to recover
Sicily: while he promised he would assist the Carthaginians
in their Italian campaign. Though the Carthaginians now saw
perfectly well the whole extent of the young man&#8217;s fickleness
and infatuation: yet thinking it to be in manifold ways to their
interests not to let Sicilian affairs out of their hands, they
assented to his demands; and having already prepared ships
and men, they set about arranging for the transport of their
forces into Sicily.</p>

<p><a name="b7_5" id="b7_5"><b>5.</b></a> When they heard of this, the Romans sent legates to him
again, protesting against his violation of the
treaty made with his forefathers. <span class="sidenote">The Romans
again remonstrate.
Another
scene at the
Council.</span>
Hieronymus
thereupon summoned a meeting of his council
consulted them as to what he was to do.
The native members of it kept silent, because
they feared the folly of their ruler. Aristomachus of Corinth,
Damippus of Sparta, Autonous of Thessaly advised that he
should abide by the treaty with Rome. Andranodorus alone
urged that he should not let the opportunity slip; and affirmed
that the present was the only chance of establishing his rule
over Sicily. After the delivery of this speech, the king
asked Hippocrates and his brother what they thought, and
upon their answering, &#8220;The same as Andranodorus,&#8221; the deliberation
was concluded in that sense. Thus, then, war with
Rome had been decided upon: but while the king was anxious
to be thought to have given an adroit answer to the ambassadors,
he committed himself to such an utter absurdity as
to make it certain that he would not only fail to conciliate the
Romans, but would inevitably offend them violently. For he
said that he would abide by the treaty, firstly, if the Romans
would repay all the gold they had received from his grandfather
Hiero; and secondly, if they would return the corn and
other presents which they had received from him from the first
day of their intercourse with him; and thirdly, if they would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
acknowledge all Sicily east of the Himera to be Syracusan
territory. At these propositions of course the <span class="sidenote">War with Rome
decided upon.</span>
ambassadors and council separated; and from
that time forth Hieronymus began pushing on
his preparations for war with energy: collected and armed his
forces, and got ready the other necessary provisions....</p>

<p><a name="b7_6" id="b7_6"><b>6.</b></a> The city of Leontini taken as a whole faces north,
and is divided in half by a valley of level ground,
in which are the state buildings, <span class="sidenote">Description of

the court-houses,
and market-place. Along each side of
this valley run hills with steep banks all the way;
the flat tops of which, reached after crossing their
brows, are covered with houses and temples. The city has two
gates, one on the southern extremity of this valley leading to
Syracuse, the other at the northern leading on to the &#8220;Leontine
plains,&#8221; and the arable district. Close under the westernmost
of the steep cliffs runs a river called Lissus; parallel to which
are built continuous rows of houses, in great numbers, close
under the cliff, between which and the river runs the road I
have mentioned....</p>

<p><a name="b7_7" id="b7_7"><b>7.</b></a> Some of the historians who have described the fall of
Hieronymus have written at great length and in
terms of mysterious solemnity. <span class="sidenote">Fall of Hieronymus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;214.</span>
They tell us of
prodigies preceding his coming to the throne,
and of the misfortunes of Syracuse. They describe in dramatic
language the cruelty of his character and the impiety of his
actions; and crown all with the sudden and terrible nature of
the circumstances attending his fall. One would think from
their description that neither Phalaris, nor Apollodorus, nor
any other tyrant was ever fiercer than he. Yet he was a mere
boy when he succeeded to power, and only lived thirteen
months after. In this space of time it is possible that one or
two men may have been put to the rack, or certain of his
friends, or other Syracusan citizens, put to death; but it is improbable
that his tyranny could have been extravagantly wicked,
or his impiety outrageous. It must be confessed that he was
reckless and unscrupulous in disposition; still we cannot
compare him with either of the tyrants I have named. The
fact is that those who write the histories of particular episodes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
having undertaken limited and narrow themes, appear to me to
be compelled from poverty of matter to exaggerate insignificant
incidents, and to speak at inordinate length on subjects that
scarcely deserve to be recorded at all. There are some, too,
who fall into a similar mistake from mere want of judgment.
With how much more reason might the space employed on
these descriptions,&mdash;which they use merely to fill up and spin
out their books,&mdash;have been devoted to Hiero and Gelo,
without mentioning Hieronymus at all! It would have given
greater pleasure to readers and more instruction to students.</p>

<p><a name="b7_8" id="b7_8"><b>8.</b></a> For, in the first place, Hiero gained the sovereignty of
Syracuse and her allies by his own unaided
abilities without inheriting wealth, <span class="sidenote">Character of
Hiero II., King
of Syracuse, from
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;269 to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
215.</span>
or reputation,
or any other advantage of fortune. And, in
the second place, was established king of Syracuse
without putting to death, banishing, or
harassing any one of the citizens,&mdash;which is the most astonishing
circumstance of all. And what is quite as surprising as
the innocence of his acquisition of power is the fact that it did
not change his character. For during a reign of fifty-four
years he preserved peace for the country, maintained his own
power free from all hostile plots, and entirely escaped the envy
which generally follows greatness; for though he tried on
several occasions to lay down his power, he was prevented by
the common remonstrances of the citizens. And having
shown himself most beneficent to the Greeks, and most
anxious to earn their good opinion, he left behind him not
merely a great personal reputation but also a universal feeling of
goodwill towards the Syracusans. Again, though he passed his
life in the midst of the greatest wealth, luxury, and abundance,
he survived for more than ninety years, in full possession of
his senses and with all parts of his body unimpaired; which,
to my mind, is a decisive proof of a well-spent life....</p>

<p>Gelo, his son, in a life of more than fifty years
<span class="sidenote">Gelo, son of

of ambition to obey his father, and to
regard neither wealth, nor sovereign power,
nor anything else as of higher value than love
and loyalty to his parents....</p>

<h3>MESSENE AND PHILIP V. IN B.C. 215</h3>

<p><a name="b7_10" id="b7_10"><b>10.</b></a> Democracy being established at Messene, and the men
of rank having been banished, while those who <span class="sidenote">Political state of
Messene.</span>
had received allotments on their lands obtained
the chief influence in the government, those of
the old citizens who remained found it very hard to put up
with the equality which these men had obtained....</p>

<p>Gorgus of Messene, in wealth and extraction, was inferior
to no one in the town; and had been a famous
athlete in his time, <span class="sidenote">The character of
the Messenian
athlete and statesman
Gorgus.
See <i>ante</i>, <b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_5">5</a>.</span>
far surpassing all rivals in
that pursuit. In fact he was not behind any
man of his day in physical beauty, or the
general dignity of his manner of life, or the
number of prizes he had won. Again, when he gave up
athletics and devoted himself to politics and the service of his
country, he gained no less reputation in this department than
in his former pursuit. For he was removed from the
Philistinism that usually characterises athletes, and was
looked upon as in the highest degree an able and clear-headed
politician....</p>

<p><a name="b7_11" id="b7_11"><b>11.</b></a> Philip, king of the Macedonians, being desirous of
seizing the acropolis of Messene, told the <span class="sidenote">Philip V. of
Macedon at
Messene, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
215. See
Plutarch, <i>Arat.</i>
49-50.</span>
leaders of the city that he wished to see it and
to sacrifice to Zeus, and accordingly walked up
thither with his attendants and joined in the
sacrifice. When, according to custom, the
entrails of the slaughtered victims were brought
to him, he took them in his hands, and, turning round a little
to one side, held them out to Aratus and asked him &#8220;what he
thought the sacrifices indicated? To quit the citadel or hold
it?&#8221; Thereupon Demetrius struck in on the spur of the
moment by saying, &#8220;If you have the heart of an augur,&mdash;to
quit it as quick as you can: but if of a gallant and wise king,
to keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good
an opportunity again: for it is by thus holding the two horns
that you can alone keep the ox under your control.&#8221; By the
&#8220;two horns&#8221; he meant Ithome and the Acrocorinthus, and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
the &#8220;ox&#8221; the Peloponnese. Thereupon Philip turned to
Aratus and said, &#8220;And do you give the same advice?&#8221;
Aratus not making any answer at once, he urged him to speak
his real opinion. After some hesitation he said, &#8220;If you can
get possession of this place without treachery to the Messenians,
I advise you to do so; but if, by the act of occupying this
citadel with a guard, you shall ruin all the citadels, and the
guard wherewith the allies were protected when they came into
your hands from Antigonus&#8221; (meaning by that, <i>confidence</i>),
&#8220;consider whether it is not better to take your men away and
leave the confidence there, and with it guard the Messenians,
and the other allies as well.&#8221; As far as his own inclination was
concerned, Philip was ready enough to commit an act of treachery,
as his own subsequent conduct proved: but having been sharply
rebuked a little while before by the younger Aratus for his
destruction of human life; and seeing that, on the present
occasion, the elder spoke with boldness and authority, and
begged him not to neglect his advice, he gave in from sheer
shame, and taking the latter by his right hand, said, &#8220;Then let
us go back the same way we came.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="b7_12" id="b7_12"><b>12.</b></a> I wish here to stop in my narrative in order to speak
briefly of the character of Philip, <span class="sidenote">Deterioration in
the character of
Philip V.
See <b>4</b>, <a href="#b4_77">77</a>.</span>
because this
was the beginning of the change and deterioration
in it. For I think that no more telling
example can be proposed to practical statesmen
who wish to correct their ideas by a study of history. For
the splendour of his early career, and the brilliancy of his
genius, have caused the dispositions for good and evil displayed
by this king to be more conspicuous and widely known
throughout Greece than is the case with any other man; as
well as the contrast between the results accompanying the
display of those opposite tendencies.</p>

<p>Now that, upon his accession to the throne, Thessaly,
Macedonia, and in fact all parts of his own kingdom were more
thoroughly loyal and well disposed to him, young as he was on
his succeeding to the government of Macedonia, than they had
ever been to any of his predecessors, may be without difficulty
inferred from the following fact. Though he was with extreme
frequency forced to leave Macedonia by the Aetolian and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
Lacedaemonian wars, not only was there no disturbance in
these countries, but not a single one of the neighbouring
barbarians ventured to touch Macedonia. It would be impossible,
again, to speak in strong enough terms of the affection
of Alexander, Chrysogonus, and his other friends towards
him; or that of the Epirotes, Acarnanians, and all those on
whom he had within a short time conferred great benefits.
On the whole, if one may use a somewhat hyperbolical phrase,
I think it has been said of Philip with very great propriety,
that his beneficent policy had made him &#8220;The darling of all
Greece.&#8221; And it is a conspicuous and striking proof of the
advantage of lofty principle and strict integrity, that the Cretans,
having at length come to an understanding with each other and
made a national alliance, selected Philip to arbitrate between
them; and that this settlement was completed without an
appeal to arms and without danger,&mdash;a thing for which it
would be difficult to find a precedent in similar circumstances.
From the time of his exploits at Messene all this was utterly
changed. And it was natural that it should be so. For his
purposes being now entirely reversed, it inevitably followed
that men&#8217;s opinions of him should be reversed also, as well as
the success of his various undertakings. This actually was the
case, as will become evident to attentive students from what
I am now about to relate....</p>

<p><a name="b7_13" id="b7_13"><b>13.</b></a> Aratus seeing that Philip was now openly engaging in
war with Rome, and entirely changed in his policy toward his
allies, with difficulty diverted him from his intention by
suggesting numerous difficulties and scruples.</p>

<p>I wish now to remind my readers of what, in my fifth Book, I
put forward merely as a promise and unsupported statement, but
which has now been confirmed by facts; in order that I may
not leave any proposition of mine unproved or open to
question. In the course of my history of the Aetolian war,
<span class="sidenote"><b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_12">12</a>.</span>
where I had to relate the violent proceedings of
Philip in destroying the colonnades and other
sacred objects at Thermus; and added that, in consideration of
his youth, the blame of these measures ought not to be referred
to Philip so much as to his advisers; I then remarked that
the life of Aratus sufficiently proved that he would not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
committed such an act of wickedness, but that such principles
exactly suited Demetrius of Pharos; and I promised to make this
clear from what I was next to narrate. I thereby designedly
postponed the demonstration of the truth of my assertion, <span class="sidenote">Recapitulation of
the substance of
book 7, viz.
the treacherous
dealings of Philip
with the
Messenians,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;215.</span>
till
I had come to the period of which I have just
been speaking; which with the
presence of Demetrius, and in the absence of
Aratus, who arrived a day too late, Philip made
the first step in his career of crime; and, as
though from the first taste of human blood and
murder and treason to his allies, was changed
not into a wolf from a man, as in the Arcadian fable
mentioned by Plato, <span class="sidenote">Plato, <i>Rep.</i>
565 D.</span>
but from a king into a
savage tyrant. But a still more decisive proof
of the sentiments of these two men is furnished
by the plot against the citadel of Messene, and may help us to
make up our minds which of the two were responsible for the
proceedings in the Aetolian war; and, when we are satisfied
on that point, it will be easy to form a judgment on the
differences of their principles.</p>

<p><a name="b7_14" id="b7_14"><b>14.</b></a> For as in this instance, under the influence of Aratus,
Philip refrained from actually breaking faith with the Messenians
in regard to the citadel; and thus, to use a common
expression, poured a little balm into the wide wound which his
slaughters had caused: so in the Aetolian war, when under the
influence of Demetrius, he sinned against the gods by destroying
the objects consecrated to them, and against man by
transgressing the laws of war; and entirely deserted his
original principles, by showing himself an implacable and
bitter foe to all who opposed him. The same remark
applies to the Cretan business.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> As long as he employed
Aratus as his chief director, not only without doing injustice
to a single islander, but without even causing them any
vexation, he kept the whole Cretan people under control; and
led all the Greeks to regard him with favour, owing to the
greatness of character which he displayed. So again, when
under the guidance of Demetrius, he became the cause of the
misfortunes I have described to the Messenians, he at once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>lost the goodwill of the allies and his credit with the rest of
Greece. Such a decisive influence for good or evil in the
security of their government has the choice by youthful
sovereigns of the friends who are to surround them; though
it is a subject on which by some unaccountable carelessness
they take not the smallest care....</p>

<h3>THE WAR OF ANTIOCHUS WITH ACHAEUS</h3>

<p class="center">(See <b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_107">107</a>)</p>

<p><a name="b7_15" id="b7_15"><b>15.</b></a> Round Sardis ceaseless and protracted skirmishes were
taking place and fighting by night and day, <span class="sidenote">Siege of Sardis
from the end of
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216 to
autumn of
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;215.</span>
both
armies inventing every possible kind of plot and
counterplot against each other: to describe
which in detail would be as useless as it would
be in the last degree wearisome. At last, when
the siege had already entered upon its second year, Lagoras
the Cretan came forward. He had had a considerable experience
in war, and had learnt that as a rule cities fall into
the hands of their enemies most easily from some neglect on
the part of their inhabitants, when, trusting to the natural or
artificial strength of their defences, they neglect to keep proper
guard and become thoroughly careless. He had observed
too, that in such fortified cities captures were effected at
the points of greatest strength, which were believed to have
been despaired of by the enemy. So in the present instance,
when he saw that the prevailing notion of the strength of
Sardis caused the whole army to despair of taking it by storm,
and to believe that the one hope of getting it was by starving
it out, he gave all the closer attention to the subject; and
eagerly scanned every possible method of making an attempt to
capture the town. Having observed therefore that a portion
of the wall was unguarded, near a place called the Saw, which
unites the citadel and city, he conceived the hope and idea of
performing this exploit. He had discovered the carelessness
of the men guarding this wall from the following circumstance.
The place was extremely precipitous: and there was a deep
gully below, into which dead bodies from the city, and the
offal of horses and beasts of burden that died, were accustomed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
to be thrown; and in this place therefore there was always a
great number of vultures and other birds collected. Having
observed, then, that when these creatures were gorged, they
always sat undisturbed upon the cliffs and the wall, he
concluded that the wall must necessarily be left unguarded and
deserted for the larger part of the day. Accordingly, under
cover of night, he went to the spot and carefully examined the
possibilities of approaching it and setting ladders; and finding
that this was possible at one particular rock, he communicated
the facts to the king.</p>

<p><a name="b7_16" id="b7_16"><b>16.</b></a> Antiochus encouraged the attempt and urged Lagoras
to carry it out. The latter promised to do his best, and
desired the king to join with him Theodotus the Aetolian, and
Dionysius the commander of his bodyguard, with orders to
devote them to assist him in carrying out the intended enterprise.
The king at once granted his request, and these officers
agreed to undertake it: and having held a consultation on the
whole subject, they waited for a night on which there should
be no moon just before daybreak. Such a night having
arrived, on the day on which they intended to act, an hour
before sunset, they selected from the whole army fifteen of
the strongest and most courageous men to carry the ladders,
and also to mount with them and share in the daring attempt.
After these they selected thirty others, to remain in reserve at
a certain distance; that, as soon as they had themselves climbed
over the walls, and come to the nearest gate, the thirty might
come up to it from the outside and try to knock off the hinges
and fastenings, while they on the inside cut the cross bar and
bolt pins.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> They also selected two thousand men to follow
behind the thirty, who were to rush into the town with them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>and seize the area of the theatre, which was a favourable position
to hold against those on the citadel, as well as those in the town.
To prevent suspicion of the truth getting about, owing to the
picking out of the men, the king gave out that the Aetolians
were about to throw themselves into the town through a certain
gully, and that it was necessary, in view of that information, to
take energetic measures to prevent them.</p>

<p><a name="b7_17" id="b7_17"><b>17.</b></a> When Lagoras and his party had made all their
preparations, as soon as the moon set, <span class="sidenote">The town of
Sardis entered
and sacked.</span>
they
came stealthily to the foot of the cliffs with
their scaling ladders, and ensconced themselves
under a certain overhanging rock. When day broke, and
the picket as usual broke up from that spot; and the king
in the ordinary way told off some men to take their usual
posts, and led the main body on to the hippodrome and
drew them up; at first no one suspected what was going on.
But when two ladders were fixed, and Dionysius led the way
up one, and Lagoras up the other, there was excitement and a
stir throughout the camp. For while the climbing party were
not visible to the people in the town, or to Achaeus in the
citadel, because of the beetling brow of the rock, their bold
and adventurous ascent was in full view of the camp; which
accordingly was divided in feeling between astonishment at
the strangeness of the spectacle, and a nervous horror of what
was going to happen next, all standing dumb with exulting
wonder. Observing the excitement in the camp, and wishing to
divert the attention both of his own men and of those in the
city from what was going on, the king ordered an advance; and
delivered an attack upon the gates on the other side of the
town, called the Persian gates. Seeing from the citadel the
unwonted stir in the camp, Achaeus was for some time at a
loss to know what to do, being puzzled to account for it, and
quite unable to see what was taking place. However he despatched
a force to oppose the enemy at the gate; whose
assistance was slow in arriving, because they had to descend
from the citadel by a narrow and precipitous path. But
Aribazus, the commandant of the town, went unsuspiciously
to the gates on which he saw Antiochus advancing; and
caused some of his men to mount the wall, and sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
others out through the gate, with orders to hinder the
approaching enemies, and come to close quarters with
them.</p>

<p><a name="b7_18" id="b7_18"><b>18.</b></a> Meanwhile Lagoras, Theodotus, Dionysius, and their
men had climbed the rocks and had arrived at the gate
nearest them; and some of them were engaged in fighting the
troops sent from the citadel to oppose them, while others were
cutting through the bars; and at the same time the party outside
told off for that service were doing the same. The gates
having thus been quickly forced open, the two thousand entered
and occupied the area round the theatre. On this all the men
from the walls, and from the Persian gate, to which Aribazus
had already led a relieving force, rushed in hot haste to pass
the word to attack the enemy within the gates. The result
was that, the gate having been opened as they retreated, some
of the king&#8217;s army rushed in along with the retiring garrison;
and, when they had thus taken possession of the gate, they were
followed by an unbroken stream of their comrades; some of
whom poured through the gate, while others employed themselves
in bursting open other gates in the vicinity. Aribazus
and all the men in the city, after a brief struggle against the
enemy who had thus got within the walls, fled with all speed to
the citadel. After that, Theodotus and Lagoras and their party
remained on the ground near the theatre, determining with
great good sense and soldier-like prudence to form a reserve
until the whole operation was completed; while the main body
rushed in on every side and occupied the town. And now by
dint of some putting all they met to the sword, others setting
fire to the houses, others devoting themselves to plunder and
taking booty, the destruction and sacking of the town was
completed. Thus did Antiochus become master of Sardis....</p>

<h2>BOOK VIII</h2>

<h3>THE NECESSITY OF CAUTION IN DEALING WITH AN ENEMY</h3>

<p><a name="b8_1" id="b8_1"><b>1.</b></a> <span class="smcap">Tiberius</span> a Roman Proconsul fell into an ambuscade,
and, after offering with his attendants a gallant

<p>Now in regard to such catastrophes, whether
it is right to blame or pardon the sufferers is
by no means a safe matter on which to pronounce
an opinion; because it has happened
to several men, who have been perfectly
correct in all their actions, to fall
into these misfortunes, equally with those
who do not scruple to transgress principles of right
confirmed by the consent of mankind. We should not however
idly refrain from pronouncing an opinion: but should
blame or condone this or that general, after a review of
the necessities of the moment and the circumstances of
the case. And my observation will be rendered evident
by the following instances. <span class="sidenote">Fall of
Archidamus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;226-225.</span>
Archidamus, king
of the Lacedaemonians, alarmed at the love
of power which he observed in Cleomenes,
fled from Sparta; but being not long afterwards persuaded
to return, put himself in the power of the latter. The
consequence was that he lost his kingdom and his life
together,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> and left a character not to be defended before
posterity on the score of prudence; for while affairs remained
in the same state, and the ambition and power
of Cleomenes remained in exactly the same position, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
could he expect to meet any other fate than he did, if he
put himself in the hands of the very men from whom he had
before barely escaped destruction by flight? <span class="sidenote">Fall of Pelopidas
in Thessaly,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;363.</span>
Again Pelopidas of Thebes, though acquainted
with the unprincipled character of the tyrant
Alexander, and though he knew thoroughly well that every
tyrant regards the leaders of liberty as his bitterest enemies,
first took upon himself to persuade Epaminondas to stand
forth as the champion of democracy, not only in Thebes, but
in all Greece also; and then, being in Thessaly in arms, for the
express purpose of destroying the absolute rule of Alexander,
he yet twice ventured to undertake a mission to him. The consequence
was that he fell into the hands of his enemies, did
great damage to Thebes, and ruined the reputation he had
acquired before; <span class="sidenote">Gnaeus Cornelius
Scipio Asina with
his fleet surprised
and captured at
Lipara,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;260.
See <b>1</b>, <a href="#b1_21">21</a>.</span>
and all by putting a rash and ill advised
confidence in the very last person in whom he
ought to have done so. Very similar to these
cases is that of the Roman Consul Gnaeus
Cornelius who fell in the Sicilian war by imprudently
putting himself in the power of the
enemy. And many parallel cases might be
quoted.</p>

<p><a name="b8_2" id="b8_2"><b>2.</b></a> The conclusion, then, is that those who put themselves
in the power of the enemy from want of proper precaution
deserve blame; but those who use every practicable precaution
not so: for to trust absolutely no one is to make all action impossible;
but reasonable action, taken after receiving adequate
security, cannot be censured. Adequate securities are oaths,
children, wives, and, strongest of all, a blameless past. To be
betrayed and entrapped by such a security as any of these is a
slur, not on the deceived, but on the deceiver. The first
object then should be to seek such securities as it is impossible
for the recipient of the confidence to evade; but since such
are rare, the next best thing will be to take every reasonable
precaution one&#8217;s self: and then, if we meet with any disaster, we
shall at least be acquitted of wrong conduct by the lookers on.
And this has been the case with many before now: of which the
most conspicuous example, and the one nearest to the times on
which we are engaged, will be the fate of Achaeus. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
omitted no possible precaution for securing his safety, but
thought of everything that it was possible for
human ingenuity to conceive: <span class="sidenote">Betrayal of
Achaeus by Bolis.
See <i>infra</i>, ch. <a href="#b8_17">17</a>-23.</span>
and yet he fell
into the power of his enemies. In this instance
his misfortune procured the pity and pardon
of the outside world for the victim, and nothing but disparagement
and loathing for the successful perpetrators....</p>

<p class="tb"><a name="b8_3" id="b8_3"><b>3.</b></a> It appears to me not to be alien to my general
purpose, and the plan which I originally laid down, to
recall the attention of my readers to the magnitude of the
events, and the persistency of purpose displayed by the two

States of Rome and Carthage. For who could think
it otherwise than remarkable that these two powers,
while engaged in so serious a war for the possession
of Italy, and one no less serious for that
of Iberia; and being still both of them equally
balanced between uncertain hopes and fears for
the future of these wars, and confronted at the
very time with battles equally formidable to either,

should yet not be content with their existing undertakings:
but should raise another controversy
as to the possession of Sardinia and Sicily;
and not content with
merely hoping for all these things, should grasp
at them with all the resources of their wealth
and warlike forces? Indeed the more we
examine into details the greater becomes
our astonishment. The Romans had two
complete armies under the two Consuls on
active service in Italy; two in Iberia in which
Gnaeus Cornelius commanded the land,
Publius Cornelius the naval forces; and
naturally the same was the case with the
Carthaginians. But besides this, a Roman
fleet was anchored off Greece, watching it and
the movements of Philip, of which first
Marcus Valerius, and afterward Publius
Sulpicius was in command. Along with all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
these undertakings Appius with a hundred quinqueremes,
and Marcus Claudius with an army,
<span class="sidenote">Marcus Claudius
Marcellus, Cos.
III., <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;214.</span>were
threatening Sicily; while Hamilcar was doing
the same on the side of the Carthaginians.</p>

<p><a name="b8_4" id="b8_4"><b>4.</b></a> By means of these facts I presume that what I more than
once asserted at the beginning of my work is now shown by
actual experience to deserve unmixed credit. I mean my
assertion, that it is impossible for historians of particular places
to get a view of universal history. For how is it possible for
a man who has only read a separate history of Sicilian or
Spanish affairs to understand and grasp the greatness of the
events? Or, what is still more important, in what manner and
under what form of polity fortune brought to pass that most
surprising of all revolutions that have happened in our time, I
mean the reduction of all known parts of the world under one
rule and governance, a thing unprecedented in the history of
mankind. In what manner the Romans took Syracuse or
Iberia may be possibly learned to a certain extent by means of
such particular histories; but how they arrived at universal
supremacy, and what opposition their grand designs met with
in particular places, or what on the other hand contributed to
their success, and at what epochs, this it is difficult to take in
without the aid of universal history. Nor, again, is it easy to
appreciate the greatness of their achievements except by the
latter method. For the fact of the Romans having sought to
gain Iberia, or at another time Sicily; or having gone on a
campaign with military and naval forces, told by itself, would
not be anything very wonderful. But if we learn that these
were all done at once, and that many more undertakings were
in course of accomplishment at the same time,&mdash;all at the cost
of one government and commonwealth; and if we see what
dangers and wars in their own territory were, at the very time,
encumbering the men who had all these things on hand: thus,
and only thus, will the astonishing nature of the events fully
dawn upon us, and obtain the attention which they deserve.
So much for those who suppose that by studying an episode
they have become acquainted with universal history....</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SIEGE OF SYRACUSE</h3>

<p><i>Hieronymus succeeded his grandfather, Hiero, in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;216,
and was assassinated in Leontini thirteen months afterwards,
in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;215. His death, however, did not bring more peaceful
relations between Syracuse and Rome, but only gave the Syracusans
more able leaders (Livy, 24, 21). After the slaughter of
Themistius and Andranodorus, who had been elected on the
board of Generals, and the cruel murder of all the royal family,
Epicydes and Hippocrates,&mdash;Syracusans by descent, but born and
brought up at Carthage, and who had been sent to Syracuse on a
special mission by Hannibal,&mdash;were elected into the vacant places
in the board of Generals. They became the leading spirits in
the Syracusan government, and for a time kept up an appearance
of wishing to come to terms with Rome; and legates were actually
sent to Marcellus, at Morgantia (near Catana). But when the
Carthaginian fleet arrived at Pachynus, Hippocrates and
Epicydes threw off their mask, and declared that the other
magistrates were betraying the town to the Romans. This
accusation was rendered more specious by the appearance of
Appius with a Roman fleet at the mouth of the harbour. A rush
was made to the shore by the inhabitants to prevent the Romans
landing; and the tumult was with difficulty composed by the
wisdom of one of the magistrates, Apollonides, who persuaded the
people to vote for the peace with Rome (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;215. Livy, 24, 21-28).
But Hippocrates and Epicydes determined not to acknowledge the
peace: they therefore provoked the Romans by plundering in or
near the Roman pale,<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> and then took refuge in Leontini.
Marcellus complained at Syracuse, but was told that Leontini
was not within Syracusan jurisdiction. Marcellus, therefore,
took Leontini. Hippocrates and Epicydes managed to escape,
and by a mixture of force and fraud contrived soon afterwards to
force their way into Syracuse, seize and put to death most of the
generals, and induce the excited mob, whom they had inspired
with the utmost dread of being betrayed to Rome, to elect them</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span><i>sole generals (Livy, 24, 29-32). The Romans at once ordered
Syracuse to be besieged, giving out that they were coming not
to wage war with the inhabitants, but to deliver them.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><a name="b8_5" id="b8_5"><b>5.</b></a> When Epicydes and Hippocrates had occupied Syracuse,
and had alienated the rest of the citizens with <span class="sidenote">Siege of Syracuse,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;215-214.</span>
themselves from the friendship of Rome, the
Romans who had already been informed of the
murder of Hieronymus, tyrant of Syracuse, appointed Appius
Claudius as Propraetor to command a land force, while
Marcus Claudius Marcellus commanded the fleet. These
officers took up a position not far from Syracuse, and
determined to assault the town from the land at Hexapylus,
and by sea at what was called Stoa Scytice in Achradina,
where the wall has its foundation close down to the sea.
Having prepared their wicker pent-houses, and darts, and
other siege material, they felt confident that, with so many
hands employed, they would in five days get their works in
such an advanced state as to give them the
advantage over the enemy. <span class="sidenote">Archimedes.</span>
But in this they
did not take into account the abilities of Archimedes; nor calculate
on the truth that, in certain circumstances, the genius
of one man is more effective than any numbers whatever.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>
However they now learnt it by experience. The city was strong
from the fact of its encircling wall lying along a chain of hills
with overhanging brows, the ascent of which was no easy task,
even with no one to hinder it, except at certain definite points.
Taking advantage of this, Archimedes had constructed such
defences both in the town, and at the places where an
attack might be made by sea, that the garrison would have
everything at hand which they might require at any moment,
and be ready to meet without delay whatever the enemy might
attempt against them.</p>

<p><a name="b8_6" id="b8_6"><b>6.</b></a> The attack was begun by Appius bringing his pent-houses,
and scaling ladders, and attempting to fix the latter
against that part of the wall which abuts on Hexapylus towards
the east. At the same time Marcus Claudius Marcellus with
sixty quinqueremes was making a descent upon Achradina. Each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
of these vessels were full of men armed with bows and slings
and javelins, with which to dislodge those who fought on the
battlements. As well as these vessels he had eight quinqueremes
in pairs. Each pair had had their oars removed,
one on the larboard and the other on the starboard side, and
then had been lashed together on the sides thus left bare.
On these double vessels, rowed by the outer oars of each of
the pair, they brought up under the walls some
engines called &#8220;Sambucae,&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Sambucae or
Harps.</span>
the construction
of which was as follows:&mdash;A ladder was made
four feet broad, and of a height to reach the top of the wall
from the place where its foot had to rest; each side of the
ladder was protected by a railing, and a covering or pent-house
was added overhead. It was then placed so that its foot
rested across the sides of the lashed-together vessels, which
touched each other with its other extremity protruding a
considerable way beyond the prows. On the tops of the masts
pulleys were fixed with ropes: and when the engines were
about to be used, men standing on the sterns of the vessels
drew the ropes tied to the head of the ladder, while others
standing on the prows assisted the raising of the machine and
kept it steady with long poles. Having then brought the
ships close in shore by using the outer oars of both vessels
they tried to let the machine down upon the wall. At the
head of the ladder was fixed a wooden stage secured on three
sides by wicker-shields, upon which stood four men who
fought and struggled with those who tried to prevent the
Sambuca from being made to rest on the battlements. But
when they have fixed it and so got above the level of the top
of the wall, the four men unfasten the wicker-shields from
either side of the stage, and walk out upon the battlements
or towers as the case may be; they are followed by their
comrades coming up by the Sambuca, since the ladder&#8217;s
foot is safely secured with ropes and stands upon both the
ships. This construction has got the name of &#8220;Sambuca,&#8221;
or &#8220;Harp,&#8221; for the natural reason, that when it is raised the
combination of the ship and ladder has very much the appearance
of such an instrument.</p>

<p><a name="b8_7" id="b8_7"><b>7.</b></a> With such contrivances and preparations were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>

and as the ships sailing up were still at a considerable
distance, he so wounded the enemy with
stones and darts, from the tighter wound and
longer engines, as to harass and perplex them to the last
degree; and when these began to carry over their heads, he
used smaller engines graduated according to the range required
from time to time, and by this means caused so much
confusion among them as to altogether check their advance
and attack; and finally Marcellus was reduced in despair to
bringing up his ships under cover of night. But when they
had come close to land, and so too near to be hit by the
catapults, they found that Archimedes had prepared another
contrivance against the soldiers who fought from the decks.
He had pierced the wall as high as a man&#8217;s stature with
numerous loop-holes, which, on the outside, were about as
big as the palm of the hand. Inside the wall he stationed
archers and cross-bows, or scorpions,<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> and by the volleys
discharged through these he made the marines useless. By
these means he not only baffled the enemy, whether at a
distance or close at hand, but also killed the greater number
of them. As often, too, as they tried to work their Sambucae,
he had engines ready all along the walls, not visible at other
times, but which suddenly reared themselves above the wall
from inside, when the moment for their use had come, and
stretched their beams far over the battlements, <span class="sidenote">570 lbs. av.</span>some of them
carrying stones weighing as much as ten talents,
and others great masses of lead. So whenever
the Sambucae were approaching, these beams swung round on
their pivot the required distance, and by means of a rope
running through a pulley dropped the stone upon the Sambucae,
with the result that it not only smashed the machine
itself to pieces, but put the ship also and all on board into the
most serious danger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b8_8" id="b8_8"><b>8.</b></a> Other machines which he invented were directed against
storming parties, who, advancing under the protection of pent-houses,
were secured by them from being hurt by missiles
shot through the walls. Against these he either shot stones
big enough to drive the marines from the prow; or let down
an iron hand swung on a chain, by which the man who
guided the crane, having fastened on some part of the prow
where he could get a hold, pressed down the lever of the
machine inside the wall; and when he had thus lifted the prow
and made the vessel rest upright on its stern, he fastened
the lever of his machine so that it could not be moved; and then
suddenly slackened the hand and chain by means of a rope
and pulley. The result was that many of the vessels heeled over
and fell on their sides: some completely capsized; while the
greater number, by their prows coming down suddenly from a
height, dipped low in the sea, shipped a great quantity of
water, and became a scene of the utmost confusion. Though
reduced almost to despair by these baffling inventions of
Archimedes, and though he saw that all his attempts were
repulsed by the garrison with mockery on their part and loss
to himself, Marcellus could not yet refrain from making a joke
at his own expense, saying that &#8220;Archimedes was using his
ships to ladle out the sea-water, but that his &#8216;harps&#8217; not having
been invited to the party were buffeted and turned out with
disgrace.&#8221; Such was the end of the attempt at storming
Syracuse by sea.</p>

<p><a name="b8_9" id="b8_9"><b>9.</b></a> Nor was Appius Claudius more successful. He, too,
was compelled by similar difficulties to desist
from the attempt; <span class="sidenote">The assault by
land repulsed.</span>
for while his men were
still at a considerable distance from the
wall, they began falling by the stones and shots from the
engines and catapults. The volleys of missiles, indeed, were
extraordinarily rapid and sharp, for their construction had been
provided for by all the liberality of a Hiero, and had been
planned and engineered by the skill of an Archimedes. Moreover,
when they did at length get near the walls, they were
prevented from making an assault by the unceasing fire
through the loop-holes, which I mentioned before; or if they
tried to carry the place under cover of pent-houses, they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
killed by the stones and beams let down upon their heads.
The garrison also did them no little damage with those hands
at the end of their engines; for they used to lift the men,
armour, and all, into the air, and then throw them down. At
last Appius retired into the camp, and summoning the Tribunes
to a council of war, decided to try every possible means of
taking Syracuse except a storm. <span class="sidenote">The siege turned
into a blockade,

And this
decision they carried out; for during the eight
months of siege which followed, though there
was no stratagem or measure of daring which they
did not attempt, they never again ventured to
attempt a storm. So true it is that one man
and one intellect, properly qualified for the particular undertaking,
is a host in itself and of extraordinary efficacy. In
this instance, at any rate, we find the Romans confident that
their forces by land and sea would enable them to become
masters of the town, if only one old man could be got rid of;
while as long as he remained there, they did not venture even
to think of making the attempt, at least by any method which
made it possible for Archimedes to oppose them. They
believed, however, that their best chance of reducing the
garrison was by a failure of provisions sufficient for so large a
number as were within the town; they therefore relied upon
this hope, and with their ships tried to cut off their supplies by
sea, and with their army by land. But desiring that the time
during which they were blockading Syracuse should not be
entirely wasted, but that some addition should be made to their
power in other parts of the country, the two commanders
separated and divided the troops between them: Appius
Claudius keeping two-thirds and continuing the blockade, while
Marcus Marcellus with the remaining third went to attack the
cities that sided with the Carthaginians....</p>

<p class="tb"><a name="b8_10" id="b8_10"><b>10.</b></a> Upon arriving in Messenia Philip began devastating the

<i>Aratus</i>, ch. 51.
Cp. <i>supra</i>, <b>7</b>, <a href="#b7_10">10</a>-14.</span>the same motives as those which I have assigned for other
parts of my work, but also by the fact that of our historians,
some have entirely omitted this Messenian episode; while
others from love or fear of kings have maintained that, so far
from the outrages committed by Philip in defiance of religion
and law upon the Messenians being a subject of blame, his
actions were on the contrary matters for praise and gratulation.
But it is not only in regard to the Messenians that we
may notice the historians of Philip acting thus; they have
done much the same in other cases also. And the result is
that their compositions have the appearance of a panegyric
rather than of a history. I however hold that an historian ought
neither to blame or praise kings untruly, as has often been
done; but to make what we say consistent with what has been
written before, and tally with the characters of the several
persons in question. But it may be urged perhaps that this is
easy to say, but very difficult to carry out; because situations
and circumstances are so many and various, to which men
have to give way in the course of their life, and which prevent
them from speaking out their real opinions. This may excuse
some, but not others.</p>

<p><a name="b8_11" id="b8_11"><b>11.</b></a> I do not know any one who deserves more blame in
this particular than Theopompus. In the beginning <span class="sidenote">The extravagance
of Theopompus&#8217;s
account of
Philip II.</span>
of his history of Philip he said that what
chiefly induced him to undertake it was the fact
that Europe had never produced such a man as
Philip son of Amyntas; and then immediately afterwards, both
in his preface and in the whole course of his history, he
represents this king as so madly addicted to women, that he
did all that in him lay to ruin his own family by this inordinate
passion; as having behaved with the grossest unfairness and
perfidy to his friends and allies, as having enslaved and
treacherously seized a vast number of towns by force or fraud;
and as having been besides so violently addicted to strong
drink, that he was often seen by his friends drunk in open day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
But if any one will take the trouble to read the opening
passage of his forty-ninth book, he would be indeed astonished
at this writer&#8217;s extravagance. Besides his other strange statements
he has ventured to write as follows&mdash;for I here subjoin
his actual words:&mdash;&#8220;If there was any one in all Greece, or among
the Barbarians, whose character was lascivious and shameless, he
was invariably attracted to Philip&#8217;s court in Macedonia and got
the title of &#8216;the king&#8217;s companion.&#8217; For it was Philip&#8217;s constant
habit to reject those who lived respectably and were careful of
their property; but to honour and promote those who were
extravagant, and passed their lives in drinking and dicing. His
influence accordingly tended not only to confirm them in these
vices, but to make them proficients in every kind of rascality
and lewdness. What vice or infamy did they not possess?
What was there virtuous or of good report that they did not
lack? Some of them, men as they were, were ever clean
shaven and smooth-skinned; and even bearded men did not
shrink from mutual defilement. They took about with them
two or three slaves of their lust, while submitting to the same
shameful service themselves. The men whom they called
companions deserved a grosser name, and the title of soldier
was but a cover to mercenary vice; for, though bloodthirsty
by nature, they were lascivious by habit. In a word, to make
a long story short, especially as I have such a mass of matter
to deal with, I believe that the so-called &#8216;friends&#8217; and
&#8216;companions&#8217; of Philip were more bestial in nature and
character than the Centaurs who lived on Pelion, or the
Laestrygones who inhabited the Leontine plain, or in fact any
other monsters whatever.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p><a name="b8_12" id="b8_12"><b>12.</b></a> Who would not disapprove of such bitterness and intemperance
of language in an historian? It is not only because
his words contradict his opening statement that he deserves
stricture; but also because he has libelled the king and his
friends; and still more because his falsehood is expressed in
disgusting and unbecoming words. If he had been speaking
of Sardanapalus, or one of his associates, he could hardly have
ventured to use such foul language; and what that monarch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>&#8217;s
principles and debauchery were in his lifetime we gather from
the inscription on his tomb, which runs thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;The joys I had from love or wine</div>
<div class="line">Or dainty meats-&#8212;those now are mine.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But when speaking of Philip and his friends, a man ought to be
on his guard, not so much of accusing them of effeminacy and
want of courage, or still more of shameless immorality, but on
the contrary lest he should prove unequal to express their praises
in a manner worthy of their manliness, indefatigable energy,
and the general virtue of their character. <span class="sidenote">The vigorous
characters of the
Diadochi.</span>
It is notorious that
by their energy and boldness they raised the
Macedonian Empire from a most insignificant
monarchy to the first rank in reputation and
extent. And, putting aside the achievements of Philip, what
was accomplished by them after his death, under the rule
of Alexander, has secured for them a reputation for valour
with posterity universally acknowledged. For although a large
share of the credit must perhaps be given to Alexander, as
the presiding genius of the whole, though so young a man;
yet no less is due to his coadjutors and friends, who won many
wonderful victories over the enemy; endured numerous desperate
labours, dangers and sufferings; and, though put into
possession of the most ample wealth, and the most abundant
means of gratifying all their desires, never lost their bodily
vigour by these means, or contracted tastes for violence or
debauchery. On the contrary, all those who were associated
with Philip, and afterwards with Alexander, became truly royal in
greatness of soul, temperance of life, and courage. Nor is it
necessary to mention any names: but after Alexander&#8217;s death,
in their mutual rivalries for the possession of various parts of
nearly all the world, they filled a very large number of histories
with the record of their glorious deeds. We may admit then
that the bitter invective of the historian Timaeus against
Agathocles, despot of Sicily, though it seems unmeasured, has
yet some reason in it,-&#8212;for it is directed against a personal
enemy, a bad man, and a tyrant; but that of Theopompus is
too scurrilous to be taken seriously.</p>

<p><a name="b8_13" id="b8_13"><b>13.</b></a> For, after premising that he is going to write about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
king most richly endowed by nature with virtue, he has raked up
against him every shameful and atrocious charge that he could
find. There are therefore but two alternatives: either this
writer in the preface to his work has shown himself a liar and
a flatterer; or in the body of that history a fool and utter
simpleton, if he imagined that by senseless and improper
invective he would either increase his own credit, or gain
great acceptance for his laudatory expressions about Philip.</p>

<p>But the fact is that the general plan of this writer is one
also which can meet with no one&#8217;s approval. <span class="sidenote">Thucydides breaks
off in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;411.
Battle of Leuctra
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;371.</span>
For
having undertaken to write a Greek History from
the point at which Thucydides left off, when he
got near the period of the battle of Leuctra, and
the most splendid exploits of the Greeks, he threw aside Greece
and its achievements in the middle of his story, and, changing
his purpose, undertook to write the history of Philip. And yet
it would have been far more telling and fair to have included
the actions of Philip in the general history of Greece, than the
history of Greece in that of Philip. For one cannot conceive
any one, who had been preoccupied by the study of a royal
government, hesitating, if he got the power and opportunity, to
transfer his attention to the great name and splendid personality
of a nation like Greece; but no one in his senses, after beginning
with the latter, would have exchanged it for the showy biography
of a tyrant. Now what could it have been that compelled
Theopompus to overlook such inconsistencies? Nothing
surely but this, that whereas the aim of his original history was
honour, that of his history of Philip was expediency. As to
this deviation from the right path however, which made him
change the theme of his history, he might perhaps have had
something to say, if any one had questioned him about it; but
as to his abominable language about the king&#8217;s friends, I do not
think that he could have said a word of defence, but must have
owned to a serious breach of propriety....</p>

<p><a name="b8_14" id="b8_14"><b>14.</b></a> Though regarding the Messenians as open enemies,
Philip was unable to inflict serious damage upon them, in spite
of his setting to work to devastate their territory; but he was
guilty of abominable conduct of the worst description to men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
who had been his most intimate friends. For on the elder
Aratus showing disapproval of his proceedings at Messene, <span class="sidenote">Death of Aratus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;213.</span>
he
caused him not long afterwards to be made
away with by poison, through the agency of
Taurion who had charge of his interests in the
Peloponnese. The crime was not known at the time by other
people; for the drug was not one of those which kill on the
spot, but was a slow poison producing a morbid state of the body.
Aratus himself however was fully aware of the cause of his illness;
and showed that he was so by the following circumstance.
Though he kept the secret from the rest of the world, he did not
conceal it from one of his servants named Cepholon, with whom
he was on terms of great affection. This man waited on him
during his illness with great assiduity, and having one day
pointed out some spittle on the wall which was stained with
blood, Aratus remarked, &#8220;That is the reward I have got for
my friendship to Philip.&#8221; Such a grand and noble thing is
disinterested virtue, that the sufferer was more ashamed, than
the inflicter of the injury, of having it known, that, after so
many splendid services performed in the interests of Philip, he
had got such a return as that for his loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

Aratus
after his death met with the honours he deserved,
both in his own native city and from the league
as a body. They voted him sacrifices and the honours of
heroship, and in a word every thing calculated to perpetuate his
memory; so that, if the departed have any consciousness, it is
but reasonable to think that he feels pleasure at the gratitude
of the Achaeans, and at the thought of the hardships and
dangers he endured in his life....</p>

<h3>PHILIP TAKES LISSUS IN ILLYRIA, B.C. 213</h3>

<p><a name="b8_15" id="b8_15"><b>15.</b></a> Philip had long had his thoughts fixed upon Lissus and
its citadel; and, being anxious to become master
of those places, <span class="sidenote">Lissus founded
by Dionysius of
Syracuse,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;385.
See Diod. Sic.
15, 13.</span>
he started with his army, and
after two days&#8217; march got through the pass and
pitched his camp on the bank of the river
Ardaxanus, not far from the town. He found
on surveying the place that the fortifications of
Lissus, both on the side of the sea and of the land, were
exceedingly strong both by nature and art; and that the citadel,
which was near it, from its extraordinary height and its other
sources of strength, looked more than any one could hope to
carry by storm. He therefore gave up all hope of the latter,
but did not entirely despair of taking the town. He observed
that there was a space between Lissus and the foot of the Acrolissus
which was fairly well suited for making an attempt upon
the town. He conceived the idea therefore of bringing on a
skirmish in this space, and then employing a stratagem suited
to the circumstances of the case. Having given his men a day
for rest; and having in the course of it addressed them in
suitable words of exhortation; he hid the greater and most
effective part of his light-armed troops during the night in
some woody gulleys, close to this space on the land side; and
next morning marched to the other side of the town next the
sea, with his peltasts and the rest of his light-armed. Having
thus marched round the town, and arrived at this spot, he
made a show of intending to assault it at that point. Now as
Philip&#8217;s advent had been no secret, a large body of men from
the surrounding country of Illyria had flocked into Lissus;
but feeling confidence in the strength of the citadel, they had
assigned a very moderate number of men to garrison it.</p>

<p><a name="b8_16" id="b8_16"><b>16.</b></a> As soon therefore as the Macedonians approached,
they began pouring out of the town, confident
in their numbers and in the strength of the places. <span class="sidenote">The Acrolissus
taken by a feint,
and Lissus afterwards.</span>
The king stationed his peltasts on the level
ground, and ordered the light-armed troops to
advance towards the hills and energetically engage the enemy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
These orders being obeyed, the fight remained doubtful for a
time; but presently Philip&#8217;s men yielded to the inequality of
the ground, and the superior number of the enemy, and gave
way. Upon their retreating within the ranks of the peltasts,
the sallying party advanced with feelings of contempt, and
having descended to the same level as the peltasts joined battle
with them. But the garrison of the citadel seeing Philip
moving his divisions one after the other slowly to the rear, and
believing that he was abandoning the field, allowed themselves
to be insensibly decoyed out, in their confidence in the strength
of their fortifications; and thus, leaving the citadel by degrees,
kept pouring down by bye-ways into the lower plain, under the
belief that they would have an opportunity of getting booty and
completing the enemy&#8217;s discomfiture. Meanwhile the division,
which had been lying concealed on the side of the mainland,
rose without being observed, and advanced at a rapid pace.
At their approach the peltasts also wheeled round and charged
the enemy. On this the troops from Lissus were thrown into
confusion, and, after a straggling retreat, got safely back into
the town; while the garrison which had abandoned the citadel
got cut off from it by the rising of the troops which had been
lying in ambush. The result accordingly was that what
seemed hopeless, namely the capture of the citadel, was
effected at once and without any fighting; while Lissus did
not fall until next day, and then only after desperate struggles,
the Macedonians assaulting with vigour and even terrific fury.
Thus Philip having, beyond all expectation, made himself
master of these places, reduced by this exploit all the
neighbouring populations to obedience; so much so that the
greater number of the Illyrians voluntarily surrendered their
cities to his protection; for it had come to be believed that,
after the storming of such strongholds as these, no fortification
and no provision for security could be of any avail against the
might of Philip.</p>

<h3>THE CAPTURE OF ACHAEUS AT SARDIS</h3>

<p class="center">(See <b>7</b>, <a href="#b7_15">15</a>-18)</p>

<p><a name="b8_17" id="b8_17"><b>17.</b></a> Bolis was by birth a Cretan, who had long enjoyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
the honours of high military rank at King Ptolemy&#8217;s court,
and the reputation of being second to none

Sosibius secures
the help of
Bolis to rescue
Achaeus.</span>
adventurous daring, and experience
in war. By repeated arguments Sosibius
secured this man&#8217;s fidelity; and when he felt
sure of his zeal and affection he communicated
the business in hand to him. He told him that he could not
do the king a more acceptable service at the present crisis
than by contriving some way of saving Achaeus. At the
moment Bolis listened, and retired without saying more than
that he would consider the suggestion. But after two or
three days&#8217; reflection, he came to Sosibius and said that he would
undertake the business; remarking that, having spent some
considerable time at Sardis, he knew its topography, and that
Cambylus, the commander of the Cretan contingent of the
army of Antiochus, was not only a fellow citizen of his but a
kinsmen and friend. It chanced moreover that Cambylus and
his men had in charge one of the outposts on the rear of the
acropolis, where the nature of the ground did not admit of
siege-works, but was guarded by the permanent cantonment of
troops under Cambylus. Sosibius caught at the suggestion,
convinced that, if Achaeus could be saved at all from his
dangerous situation, it could be better accomplished by the
agency of Bolis than of any one else; and, this conviction being
backed by great zeal on the part of Bolis, the undertaking was
pushed on with despatch. Sosibius at once supplied the
money necessary for the attempt, and promised a large sum
besides in case of its success; at the same time raising the
hopes of Bolis to the utmost by dilating upon the favours he
might look for from the king, as well as from the rescued
prince himself.</p>

<p>Full of eagerness therefore for success, Bolis set sail without
delay, taking with him a letter in cipher and other
credentials addressed to Nicomachus at Rhodes, who was
believed to entertain a fatherly affection and devotion for
Achaeus, and also to Melancomas at Ephesus; for these were
the men formerly employed by Achaeus in his negotiations
with Ptolemy, and in all other foreign affairs.</p>

<p><a name="b8_18" id="b8_18"><b>18.</b></a> Bolis went to Rhodes, and thence to Ephesus; communicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
his purpose to Nicomachus and Melancomas; and
found them ready to do what they were asked. He then
despatched one of his staff, named Arianus, to Cambylus, with
a message to the effect that he had been sent from Alexandria
on a recruiting tour, and that he wished for an interview with
Cambylus on some matters of importance; he thought it
therefore necessary to have a time and place arranged for them
to meet without the privity of a third person. Arianus quickly
obtained an interview with Cambylus and delivered his
message; nor was the latter at all unwilling to listen to the
proposal. Having appointed a day, and a place known to
both himself and Bolis, at which he would be after nightfall,
he dismissed Arianus. Now Bolis had all the subtlety of a
Cretan, and he accordingly weighed carefully in his own mind
every possible line of action, and patiently examined every
idea which presented itself to him. <span class="sidenote">Bolis turns
traitor.</span>
Finally he
met Cambylus according to the arrangement
made with Arianus, and delivered his letter. This
was now made the subject of discussion between them in a
truly Cretan spirit. They never took into consideration the
means of saving the person in danger, or their obligations of
honour to those who had entrusted them with the undertaking,
but confined their discussions entirely to the question of their
own safety and their own advantage. As they were both
Cretans they were not long in coming to an unanimous
agreement: which was, first of all, to divide the ten talents
supplied by Sosibius between themselves in equal shares; and,
secondly, to discover the whole affair to Antiochus, and to
offer with his support to put Achaeus into his hands, on
condition of receiving a sum of money and promises for the
future, on a scale commensurate with the greatness of the
undertaking. Having settled upon this plan of action:
Cambylus undertook the negotiation with Antiochus, while to
Bolis was assigned the duty of sending Arianus within the
next few days to Achaeus, bearing letters in cipher from
Nicomachus and Melancomas: he bade Cambylus however
take upon himself to consider how Arianus was to make his
way into the acropolis and return with safety. &#8220;If,&#8221; said
Bolis, &#8220;Achaeus consents to make the attempt, and sends an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
answer to Nicomachus and Melancomas, I will be ready to
act and will communicate with you.&#8221; Having thus arranged
the parts which each was to take in the plot, they separated
and set about their several tasks.</p>

<p><a name="b8_19" id="b8_19"><b>19.</b></a> At the first opportunity Cambylus laid the proposal
before the king. It was as acceptable to
Antiochus as it was unexpected: <span class="sidenote">The intended
treason against
Achaeus communicated
to
Antiochus.</span>
in the first
flush of his exultation he promised everything
they asked; but presently feeling some distrust,
he questioned Cambylus on every detail of their
plan, and their means of carrying it out. Being eventually
satisfied on these points, and believing that the undertaking
was under the special favour of Providence, he repeatedly
begged and prayed Cambylus to bring it to a conclusion.
Bolis was equally successful with Nicomachus and Melancomas.
They entertained no doubt of his sincerity, and joined him in
the composition of letters to Achaeus,&mdash;composed in a
cipher which they had been accustomed to use,&mdash;to prevent
any one who got hold of the letter from making out its contents,
exhorting him to trust Bolis and Cambylus. So Arianus,
having by the aid of Cambylus made his way into the acropolis,
delivered the letters to Achaeus; and having had personal
acquaintance with the whole business from its commencement,
he was able to give an account of every detail when questioned
and cross-questioned again and again by Achaeus about
Sosibius and Bolis, about Nicomachus and Melancomas, and
most particularly about the part which Cambylus was taking
in the affair. He could of course stand this cross-examination
with some air of sincerity and candour, because, in point of
fact, he was not acquainted with the most important part of
the plan which Cambylus and Bolis had
adopted. <span class="sidenote">Achaeus is
deceived.</span>
Achaeus was convinced by the
answers returned by Arianus, and still more
by the cipher of Nicomachus and Melancomas; gave his
answer; and sent Arianus back with it without delay. This
kind of communication was repeated more than once: and at
last Achaeus entrusted himself without reserve to Nicomachus,
there being absolutely no other hope of saving himself left
remaining, and bade him send Bolis with Arianus on a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
moonless night, promising to place himself in their hands.
The idea of Achaeus was, first of all, to escape his immediate
danger; and then by a circuitous route to make his way into
Syria. For he entertained very great hopes that, if he appeared
suddenly and unexpectedly to the Syrians, while Antiochus
was still lingering about Sardis, he would be able to stir up a
great movement, and meet with a cordial reception from the
people of Antioch, Coele-Syria, and Phoenicia.</p>

<p>With such expectations and calculations Achaeus was
waiting for the appearance of Bolis.</p>

<p><a name="b8_20" id="b8_20"><b>20.</b></a> Meanwhile Arianus had reached Melancomas, who, on
reading the letter which he brought, immediately despatched
Bolis with many words of exhortation and great promises of
profit if he succeeded in his enterprise. Bolis sent Arianus
in advance to signify his arrival to Cambylus, and went after
nightfall to their usual place of meeting. There they spent a
whole day together settling every detail of their plan of
operations; and having done this they went into the camp
under cover of night. The arrangement made between them
was this. If it turned out that Achaeus came from the
acropolis alone with Bolis and Arianus, or with only one
attendant, he would give them no cause for anxiety at all,
but would be easily captured by the ambuscade set for him.
If, on the other hand, he should be accompanied by a
considerable number, the business would be one of some
difficulty to those on whose good faith he relied; especially
as they were anxious to capture him alive, that being what
would most gratify Antiochus. In that case, therefore, Arianus,
while conducting Achaeus, was to go in front, because he knew
the path by which he had on several occasions effected his
entrance and return; Bolis was to bring up the rear, in order
that, when they arrived at the spot where Cambylus was to
have his ambuscade ready, he might lay hold on Achaeus, and
prevent his getting away through wooded ground, in the confusion
and darkness of the night, or throwing himself in his
terror from some precipice; thus they would secure that he
fell, as they intended, into his enemies&#8217; hands alive.</p>

<p>These arrangements having been agreed upon, Bolis was
taken by Cambylus on the very night of his arrival, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
any one else, and introduced to Antiochus. The king was
alone and received them graciously; he pledged himself to
the performance of his promises, and urged them both again
and again not to postpone any longer the performance of their
purpose. Thereupon they returned for the present to their
own camp; but towards morning Bolis, accompanied by
Arianus, ascended to the acropolis, and entered it before
daybreak.</p>

<p><a name="b8_21" id="b8_21"><b>21.</b></a> Achaeus received them with warmth and cordiality,
and questioned Bolis at great length on every
detail. <span class="sidenote">Achaeus takes
vain precautions.</span>
From the expression of his face, and
his conversation, he judged Bolis to be a man of
a character weighty enough for so serious an undertaking; but
while at one time he exulted in the prospect of his release, at
another, he grew painfully excited, and was torn with an agony of
anxiety at the gravity of the issues at stake. But no one had a
clearer head or greater experience in affairs than he; and in spite
of the good opinion he had formed of him, he still determined
that his safety should not depend entirely on the good faith of
Bolis. He accordingly told him that it was impossible for
him to leave the acropolis at the moment: but that he would
send some two or three of his friends with him, and by the
time that they had joined Melancomas he would be prepared
to depart. So Achaeus did all he could for his security; but
he did not know that he was trying to do what the proverb
declares to be impossible&mdash;out-cretan a Cretan. For there was
no trick likely to be tried that Bolis had not anticipated. However
when the night came, in which Achaeus said that he would
send his friends with them, he sent on Arianus and Bolis to the
entrance of the acropolis, with instructions to wait there until
those who were to go with them arrived. They did as he bade
them. Achaeus then, at the very moment of his departure,
communicated his plan to his wife Laodice; and she was so
terrified at his sudden resolve, that he had to spend some time
in entreating her to be calm, in soothing her feelings, and
encouraging her by pointing out the hopes which he entertained.
This done he started with four companions, whom he
dressed in ordinary clothes, while he himself put on a mean
and common dress and disguised his rank as much as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
He selected one of his four companions to be always prepared
to answer anything said by Arianus, and to ask any necessary
question of him, and bade him say that the other four did not
speak Greek.</p>

<p><a name="b8_22" id="b8_22"><b>22.</b></a> The five then joined Arianus, and they all started
together on their journey. Arianus went in
front, <span class="sidenote">Achaeus made
prisoner.</span>
as being acquainted with the way; while
Bolis took up his position behind in accordance
with the original plan, puzzled and annoyed at the way things
were turning out. For, Cretan as he was, and ready to suspect
every one he came near, he yet could not make out which of
the five was Achaeus, or whether he was there at all. But the
path was for the most part precipitous and difficult, and in
some places there were abrupt descents which were slippery
and dangerous; and whenever they came to one of these,
some of the four gave Achaeus a hand down, and the others
caught him at the bottom, for they could not entirely conceal
their habitual respect for him; and Bolis was quick to detect,
by observing this, which of them was Achaeus. When therefore
they arrived at the spot at which it had been arranged that
Cambylus was to be, Bolis gave the signal by a whistle, and
the men sprang from their places of concealment and seized
the other four, while Bolis himself caught hold of Achaeus,
at the same time grasping his mantle, as his hands were inside
it; for he was afraid that having a sword concealed about his
person he would attempt to kill himself when he understood
what was happening. Being thus quickly surrounded on every
side, Achaeus fell into the hands of his enemies, and along
with his four friends was taken straight off to Antiochus.</p>

<p>The king was in his tent in a state of extreme anxiety
awaiting the result. He had dismissed his
usual court, <span class="sidenote">Achaeus brought
to Antiochus,
sentenced and
executed.</span>
and, with the exception of two
or three of the bodyguard, was alone and
sleepless. But when Cambylus and his men
entered, and placed Achaeus in chains on the ground, he fell
into a state of speechless astonishment: and for a considerable
time could not utter a word, and finally overcome by a feeling
of pity burst into tears; caused, I have no doubt, by this
exhibition of the capriciousness of Fortune, which defies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
precaution and calculation alike. For here was Achaeus, a
son of Andromachus, the brother of Seleucus&#8217;s queen Laodice,
and married to Laodice, a daughter of King Mithridates, and
who had made himself master of all Asia this side of Taurus,
and who at that very moment was believed by his own army,
as well as by that of his enemy, to be safely ensconced in
the strongest position in the world,&mdash;sitting chained upon the
ground, in the hands of his enemies, before a single person
knew of it except those who had effected the capture.</p>

<p><a name="b8_23" id="b8_23"><b>23.</b></a> And, indeed, when at daybreak the king&#8217;s friends
assembled as usual at his tent, and saw this strange spectacle,
they too felt emotions very like those of the king; while extreme
astonishment made them almost disbelieve the evidence of their
senses. However the council met, and a long debate ensued
as to what punishment they were to inflict upon Achaeus.
Finally, it was resolved that his extremities should be cut off,
his head severed from his body and sewn up in the skin of an
ass, and his body impaled. When this sentence had been
carried out, and the army learnt what had happened, there
was such excitement in the ranks and such a rush of the soldiers
to the spectacle, that Laodice on the acropolis, who alone
knew that her husband had left it, guessed what had happened
from the commotion and stir in the camp. And before long
a herald arrived, told Laodice what had happened to Achaeus,
and ordered her to resign the command and quit the
acropolis. <span class="sidenote">The citadel
of Sardis surrendered.</span>
At first any answer was prevented
by an outburst of sorrow and overpowering
lamentation on the part of the occupants of
the acropolis; not so much from affection towards Achaeus,
as from the suddenness and utter unexpectedness of the
catastrophe. But this was succeeded by a feeling of
hesitation and dismay; and Antiochus, having got rid of
Achaeus, never ceased putting pressure on the garrison of
the acropolis, feeling confident that a means of taking it
would be put into his hands by those who occupied it, and
most probably by the rank and file of the garrison. And this
is just what did finally happen: for the soldiers split up into
factions, one joining Ariobazus, the other Laodice. This
produced mutual distrust, and before long both parties surrendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
themselves and the acropolis. Thus Achaeus, in spite
of having taken every reasonable precaution, lost his life by
the perfidy of those in whom he trusted. His fate may teach
posterity two useful lessons,&mdash;not to put faith in any one
lightly; and not to be over-confident in the hour of prosperity,
knowing that, in human affairs, there is no accident which we
may not expect....</p>

Xerxes at first conveyed himself away; but
feeling afterwards that, if his palace were seized
by his enemies, his whole kingdom would be
overthrown, he changed his mind, and sent a
message to Antiochus declaring his wish for
a conference. The most loyal of the friends
of Antiochus were against letting the young
prince go when they once got him into their
hands, and advised Antiochus to take possession of the town,
and hand over the principality to Mithridates, his own sister&#8217;s
son. The king, however, would not listen to any of these
suggestions; but sent for the young prince and accommodated
their differences, forgiving him the larger part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
money which he allowed to be owing from his father under
the head of tribute, and accepting a present payment from him
of three hundred talents, a thousand horses, and a thousand
mules with their trappings. He then settled the government
of the city, and gave the prince his sister Antiochis as a wife.
By these proceedings, in which he was thought to have acted
with true royal magnanimity, he won the affection and
support of all the inhabitants of that part of the country.</p>

<h3>THE HANNIBALIAN WAR&mdash;TARENTUM</h3>

<p><a name="b8_26" id="b8_26"><b>26.</b></a> It was in the wantonness of excessive prosperity that
the Tarentines invited Pyrrhus of Epirus; for democratic
liberty that has enjoyed a long and unchecked career comes
naturally to experience a satiety of its blessings, and then it
looks out for a master; and when it has got one, it is not
long before it hates him, because it is seen that the change is
for the worse. This is just what happened to the Tarentines
on that occasion....</p>

<p>On this news being brought to Tarentum and Thurii there
was great popular indignation....</p>

<p>The conspirators left the town at first under the pretext of
a foray, and got near Hannibal&#8217;s camp before
daybreak. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal
marched south
early in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;212
to renew his
attempt upon
Tarentum, on
which he had
wasted much of
the previous summer
(Livy, 25, 1).
The severity of
the punishment
of the Tarentine
hostages who tried
to escape from
Rome caused a
conspiracy of Tarentines
to betray
the town to
Hannibal. Livy,
25, 7-8.</span>
Then, while the rest crouched down
on a certain wooded spot by the side of the
road, Philemenus and Nicon went up to the
camp. They were seized by the sentries and
taken off to Hannibal, without saying a word as
to where they came from or who they were, but
simply stating that they wished for an interview
with the general. Being taken without delay
to Hannibal they said that they wished to
speak with him privately. He assented with
the utmost readiness; whereupon they explained
to him their own position and that of their
native city, charging the Romans with many
various acts of oppression, that they might not
seem to be entering on their present undertaking
without good reason. For the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
Hannibal dismissed them with thanks and a cordial acceptance
of their proposed movement, and charging them to come back
very soon and have another interview with him. &#8220;This time,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;when you get at a sufficient distance from the camp,
take possession of the first cattle you find being driven out to
pasture in the early morning, and go off boldly with them and
their herdsmen; for I will take care that you are unmolested.&#8221;
His object in doing this was to give himself time to inquire
into the tale of the young men; and also to confirm their credit
with their fellow-citizens, by making it appear that their
expedition had really been for the purpose of foraging.
Nicon and his companions did as they were bidden, and left
Hannibal in great exultation at having at last got an opportunity
of completing his enterprise: while they themselves
were made all the more eager to carry out their plot by having
been able to accomplish their interview with Hannibal without
danger, and by having found him warmly disposed to their
undertaking, and by having besides gained the confidence of
their own people by the considerable amount of booty which
they had brought home. This they partly sold and partly
used in splendid entertainments, and thus not only were
believed in by the Tarentines, but excited a considerable
number to emulate their exploit.</p>

<p><a name="b8_27" id="b8_27"><b>27.</b></a> On their next expedition, which they conducted in the
same way as the first, they interchanged pledges
of fidelity with Hannibal on the following conditions:
<span class="sidenote">Bargain made
with Hannibal.</span>
&#8220;He was to set the Tarentines free;
and the Carthaginians were neither to exact tribute of any sort
from them, nor impose any burden upon them; but the houses
and lodgings occupied by Romans should, on their taking
possession of the town, be given up to the Carthaginians to
plunder.&#8221; They also arranged on a watchword at which the
sentries were to admit them without delay into the camp
whenever they came. After making these arrangements, they
got the opportunity of often having interviews with Hannibal:
sometimes pretending to be going out of the town on a foray,
and sometimes on a hunting expedition. Everything having
thus been put in train, the greater part of the conspirators
waited for the proper occasions for acting, while they assigned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
to Philemenus the part of leader of their hunting excursions; for,
owing to his excessive taste for that amusement, he had the reputation
of thinking hunting the most important thing in life.
Accordingly they left it to him, first to win the favour of Gaius
Livius the commander of the town by presents of game, and
then that of the guards of the gate-tower which protected what
were called the Temenid gates. Philemenus undertook the
task: and partly by what he caught himself, and partly with what
Hannibal supplied, always managed to bring in some game;
which he divided between Livius and the guards of the gate,
to induce them to be always ready to open the wicket to him.
For he generally went and returned from his expeditions after
nightfall, under the pretext of being afraid of the enemy, but
really with a view of preparing for the plot. When Philemenus
then had managed to make it a regular arranged thing with
the picket at the gate, that the guards should have no hesitation;
but that, whenever he came under the wall and whistled, they
should open the wicket to him; he waited for a day on which
the Roman commander of the town was engaged to be present
at a large party, meeting early in the Musaeum, which is near
the agora, and agreed with Hannibal to carry out their plot
on that day.</p>

<p><a name="b8_28" id="b8_28"><b>28.</b></a> For some time before this, Hannibal had given out that
he was ill, to prevent the Romans wondering <span class="sidenote">Hannibal prepares
to act.</span>
when they were told of his staying so long on
the same ground; and he now made a greater
pretence than ever of ill-health, and remained encamped three
days&#8217; march from Tarentum. But when the time was come, he
got ready the most conspicuous for their speed and daring in
his cavalry and infantry, to the number of about ten thousand,
and gave orders that they should take provisions for four days.
He started just before daybreak, and marched at full speed;
having told off eighty Numidian horsemen to keep thirty stades
ahead, and to scour the country on both sides of the road; so
that no one might get a sight of the main body, but might
either be taken prisoners by this advanced guard, or, if he
escaped, might carry a report of it into the city as if it were
merely a raid of Numidian horsemen. When the Numidians
were about a hundred and twenty stades from the town,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
Hannibal halted his men for supper by the side of a river
flowing through a deep gully, and offering excellent cover; and
having summoned his officers, did not indeed tell them outright
what the service was on which they were going, but
simply exhorted them, first to show themselves brave men,
as the prize awaiting them was the greatest they had ever had;
and, secondly, that each should keep the men of his own
company well together, and rebuke sharply all who left their
own division on any pretext whatever; and, thirdly, to attend
strictly to orders, and not attempt anything on their own account
outside them. Dismissing the officers with these words, he got
his troops on the march just after dark, being very anxious to
reach the wall about midnight; having Philemenus to act as
guide, and having got ready for him a wild-boar to enable
him to sustain the part which he was to perform.</p>

<p><a name="b8_29" id="b8_29"><b>29.</b></a> About sunset news was brought to Gaius Livius, who
had been with his friends in the Musaeum since
early in the day, <span class="sidenote">Gaius Livius
thrown off the
scent.</span>
just when the drinking was at
its height, that the Numidians were scouring
the country. He therefore took measures for that and
nothing more, calling some of his officers and bidding
them take half the cavalry, and sally out to stop the progress
of the enemy, who were devastating the country: but this
only made him still more unsuspicious of the whole extent
of the movement. Nicon, Tragiscus, and their confederates
collected together at nightfall in the town and waited for the
return of Livius and his friends. As these last rose from table
somewhat early, because the banquet had begun before the usual
time, the greater number of the conspirators retired to a certain
spot and there remained; but some of the younger men went to
meet Gaius, imitating by their disorderly procession and mutual
jests a company returning from a carouse. As Livius and his
company were even more flustered with drink, as soon as
they met laughter and joking were readily excited on both
sides. Finally, they turned and conducted Gaius to his house;
where he went to bed full of wine, as might be expected after
a party beginning so early in the day, without any anxiety or
trouble in his thoughts, but full of cheerfulness and idle
content. Then Nicon and Tragiscus rejoined their companions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
and, dividing themselves into three companies, took
up their positions at the most favourable points in the market-place,
to keep themselves fully acquainted with everything
reported from outside the walls, or that happened within the
city itself. They posted some also close to the house of
Livius: being well aware that, if any suspicion of what was
coming arose, it would be to him that the news would be first
brought, and that from him every measure taken would
originate. So when the noise of the returning guests, and every
disturbance of the sort, had subsided, and the great bulk of the
citizens was asleep; and now the night was advancing, and
nothing had happened to dash their hopes, they collected
together and proceeded to perform their part of the undertaking.</p>

<p><a name="b8_30" id="b8_30"><b>30.</b></a> The arrangements between these young men and
Hannibal were these. Hannibal was to arrive at the town by the
inland road and on the eastern side near the Temenid gates;
and when there, was to light a fire on the tomb, which some
called the tomb of Hyacinthus, and others of Apollo: Tragiscus
and his confederates, when they saw this, were to light an
answering fire from within the walls. This done, Hannibal
was to put out his fire and advance slowly towards the gate.
In pursuance of these arrangements, the young men marched
<span class="sidenote">Why the
Tarentines bury
within the walls.</span>
through the inhabited part of the town and
came to the tombs. For the eastern quarter of
Tarentum is full of monuments, because those who
die there are to this day all buried within the walls, in obedience
to an ancient oracle. For it is said that the god delivered
this answer to the Tarentines, &#8220;That it were better and more
profitable for them if they made their dwelling with the majority&#8221;;
and they thought therefore that they would be living
in accordance with the oracle if they kept the departed within
the walls. That is why to this day they bury inside the gates.</p>

<p>The young men, then, having gone as far as the tomb of
Pythionicus, waited to see what would happen.
<span class="sidenote">Hannibal arrives
and gets into the
town.</span>
Presently Hannibal arrived and did as arranged:
whereupon Nicon and Tragiscus with renewed
courage displayed their beacon also; and, as soon as they saw
the fire of the Carthaginians being put out, they ran to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
gates as fast as they could go, wishing to get the picket at the
gate tower killed before the Carthaginians arrived; as it had
been agreed that they should advance leisurely and at a foot&#8217;s
pace. Everything went smoothly: the guards were overpowered;
and while some of the young men were engaged in
killing them, others were cutting the bolts. The gates having
been quickly thrown open, Hannibal arrived at the right
moment, having so timed his march that he never had to stop
on the way to the town at all.</p>

<p><a name="b8_31" id="b8_31"><b>31.</b></a> Having thus effected their intended entrance, without
danger or any disturbance whatever, and thinking that the most
important part of their undertaking was accomplished, the
Carthaginians now began advancing boldly along the street
leading up from what is called the Batheia or Deep Road.
They left the cavalry however outside the walls, numbering as
many as two thousand, intending them to act as a reserve both
in case of any appearance of the enemy from without, and of
any of those unforeseen casualties which do occur in such
operations. But when they had come to the immediate
neighbourhood of the market-place, they halted, and waited
to see how the attempt of Philemenus would turn out: being
anxious as to the success of this part of their plan as well as
the other. For at the same moment that he lighted his fire,
and was on the point of starting for the gates, Hannibal had
despatched Philemenus also, <span class="sidenote">Philemenus also
gets in.</span>
with his boar on
a litter, and a thousand Libyans, to the next
gate; wishing, in accordance with his original
design, not to depend solely on one chance, but to have several.
When Philemenus, then, arrived at the wall and gave his
customary signal by whistling, the sentry immediately appeared
coming down to open the wicket; and when Philemenus told
him from outside to open quickly because they had a great
weight to carry, as they were bringing a wild boar, he made
haste to open the wicket, expecting that some of the game
which Philemenus was conveying would come his way, as
he had always had a share of what was brought in.</p>

<p>Thereupon Philemenus himself, being at the head of the
litter, entered first; and with him another dressed like a
shepherd, as though he were one of the country folk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
of those parts; and after him two others besides who were
carrying the dead beast behind. But when the four had
got inside the wicket, they struck and killed the man who
opened it, as he was unsuspiciously examining and feeling the
boar, and then let the men who were just behind them, and
were in advance of the main body of Libyan horsemen, to
the number of thirty, leisurely and quietly through. This
having been accomplished without a hitch, some set about
cutting the bolts, others were engaged in killing the picket
on duty at the gate, and others in giving the signal to
the Libyans still outside to come in. These having also
effected their entrance in safety, they began making their way
towards the market-place according to the arrangement. As
soon as he was joined by this division also, in great delight at
the successful progress of the operation, Hannibal proceeded
to carry out the next step.</p>

<p><a name="b8_32" id="b8_32"><b>32.</b></a> He told off two thousand of his Celts: and, having
divided them into three companies, he assigned two of the
young men who had managed the plot to each company; and
sent with them also certain of his own officers, with orders to
close up the several most convenient streets that led to the
market-place. And when he had done this, he bade the
young men of the town pick out and save those of their
fellow-citizens whom they might chance to meet, by shouting
out before they came up with them, &#8220;That Tarentines should
remain where they were, as they were in no danger&#8221;; but he
ordered both Carthaginian and Celtic officers to kill all the
Romans they met.</p>

<p>So these companies separated and proceeded to carry out
their orders. But when the entrance of the <span class="sidenote">Escape of Livius
into the Citadel.</span>
enemy became known to the Tarentines, the
city began to be full of shouting and extraordinary
confusion. As for Gaius, when the enemy&#8217;s entrance was
announced to him, being fully aware that his drunkenness had
incapacitated him, he rushed straight out of the house with his
servants, and having come to the gate leading to the harbour,
and the sentinel having opened the wicket for him, he got
through that way; and having seized one of the boats lying at
anchor there, went on board it with his servants and arrived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
safely at the citadel. Meanwhile Philemenus had provided
himself with some Roman bugles, <span class="sidenote">Massacre of
Roman soldiers.</span>
and some
men who were able to blow them, from being
used to do so; and they stood in the theatre and
sounded a call to arms. The Romans promptly rallying in
arms, as was their custom at this sound, and directing their
steps towards the citadel, everything happened exactly as the
Carthaginians intended; for as the Roman soldiers came into
the streets, without any order and in scattered groups, some of
them came upon the Carthaginians and others upon the Celts;
and by their being in this way put to the sword in detail, a
very considerable number of them perished.</p>

<p>But when day began to break, the Tarentines kept quietly
in their houses, not yet being able to comprehend what was
happening. For thanks to the bugle, and the absence of all
outrage or plundering in the town, they thought that the
movement arose from the Romans themselves. But the sight
of many of the latter lying killed in the streets, and the
spectacle of some Gauls openly stripping the Roman corpses,
suggested a suspicion of the presence of the Carthaginians.</p>

<p><a name="b8_33" id="b8_33"><b>33.</b></a> Presently when Hannibal had marched his forces into
the market-place, and the Romans had retired
into the citadel, <span class="sidenote">Roman houses
sacked, Tarentines
spared.</span>
as having been previously
secured by them with a garrison, and it had
become broad daylight, the Carthaginian general caused a
proclamation to be made to the Tarentines to assemble in full
number in the market-place; while the young conspirators
went meanwhile round the town talking loudly about liberty,
and bidding everybody not to be afraid, for the Carthaginians had
come to save them. Such of the Tarentines as held to their
loyalty to Rome, upon learning the state of the case, went off
to the citadel; but the rest came to the meeting, in obedience
to the proclamation, without their arms: and to them Hannibal
addressed a cordial speech. The Tarentines heartily cheered
everything he said from joy at their unexpected safety; and he
dismissed the crowd with an injunction to each man, to go with
all speed to his own house, and write over the door, &#8220;A
Tarentine&#8217;s&#8221;; but if any one wrote the same word on a house
where a Roman was living, he declared the penalty to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
death. He then personally told off the best men he had for
the service, and sent them to plunder the houses of the
Romans; giving them as their instructions to consider all
houses which had no inscription as belonging to the enemy:
the rest of his men he kept drawn up as a reserve.</p>

<p><a name="b8_34" id="b8_34"><b>34.</b></a> A vast quantity of miscellaneous property having been
got together by this plundering, and a booty
fully answering the expectations of the Carthaginians,
<span class="sidenote">Fortifications
raised to preserve
the town from
attack from the
citadel.</span>
they bivouacked for that night under
arms. But the next day, after consulting with the
Tarentines, Hannibal decided to cut off the city
from the citadel by a wall, that the Tarentines might not any
longer be under continual alarm from the Romans in possession
of the citadel. His first measure was to throw up a
palisade, parallel to the wall of the citadel and to the trench in
front of it. But as he very well knew that the enemy would
not allow this tamely, but would make a demonstration of their
power in that direction, he got ready for the work a number
of his best hands, thinking that the first thing necessary was to
overawe the Romans and give confidence to the Tarentines.
But as soon as the first palisade was begun, the Romans began
a bold and determined attack; whereupon Hannibal, offering
just enough resistance to induce the rest to come out, as soon
as the greater part of them had crossed the trench, gave the
word of command to his men and charged the enemy. A
desperate struggle ensued; for the fight took place in a narrow
space surrounded by walls; but at last the Romans were forced
to turn and fly. Many of them fell in the actual fighting, but
the larger number were forced over the edge of the trench and
were killed by the fall over its steep bank.</p>

<p><a name="b8_35" id="b8_35"><b>35.</b></a> For the present Hannibal, after completing the palisade
unmolested, was content to remain quiet, as his
plan had succeeded to his wish; <span class="sidenote">Further works of
security.</span>
for he had
shut in the enemy and compelled them to
remain inside their wall, in terror for the safety of the citadel
as well as for their own; while he had raised the courage of
the citizens of Tarentum to such an extent, that they now
imagined themselves to be a match for the Romans, even
without the Carthaginians. A little later he made at a short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
distance from the palisade, in the direction of the town, a trench
parallel to the palisade and the wall of the citadel; and the
earth dug out from it having been piled up on the other side
along the edge nearest the town, he erected another palisade
on the top, thus making a fortification no less secure than the
wall itself. Once more, at a moderate distance, nearer the city,
he commenced building a wall, starting from the street called
Soteira up to that called Batheia; so that, even without a garrison,
the Tarentines were adequately protected by the mere constructions
themselves. Then leaving a sufficient garrison, and
enough cavalry to serve on outpost duty for the protection of the
wall, he encamped along the bank of the river which is called by
some the Galaesus, but by most people the Eurotas, after the
river which flows past Sparta. The Tarentines have many
such derived names, both in town and country, from the
acknowledged fact of their being a colony from Sparta and
connected by blood with the Lacedaemonians. As the wall
quickly approached completion, owing to the activity and zeal
of the Tarentines, and the vigorous co-operation of the Carthaginians,
Hannibal next conceived the idea of taking the
citadel also.</p>

<p><a name="b8_36" id="b8_36"><b>36.</b></a> But when he had already completed the preparation
of the necessary engines for the assault, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal&#8217;s
arrangements for
storming the
citadel frustrated.</span>
the
Romans received some slight encouragement
on a reinforcement throwing itself into the
citadel by sea from Metapontium; and consequently
they sallied out by night and attacked the works, and
destroyed all Hannibal&#8217;s apparatus and engines.
After this Hannibal abandoned the idea of a
storm: but as the new wall was now completed,
he summoned a meeting of the Tarentines and pointed out to
<span class="sidenote">Romans reinforced.</span>them that the most imperative necessity, in view of the present
state of things, was to get command of the sea. For as the citadel
commanded the entrance to the harbour, the Tarentines could
not use their ships nor sail out of it; while the Romans could
get supplies conveyed to them by sea without danger: and as
long as that was the case, it was impossible that the city should
have any security for its freedom. <span class="sidenote">New plans for
cutting off the Roman supplies
by sea.</span>
Hannibal
saw this clearly, and explained to the Tarentines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
that, if the enemy on the citadel were
deprived of hope of succour by sea, they
would at once give way, and abandon it of their own accord,
without attempting to defend the place. The Tarentines were
fully convinced by his words: but how it was to be brought
about in the present state of affairs they could form no idea,
unless a fleet should appear from Carthage; which at that
time of the year was impossible. They therefore said that they
could not understand what Hannibal was aiming at in these
remarks to them. When he replied that it was plain that,
even without the Carthaginians, they were all but in command
of the sea, they were still more puzzled, and could not guess
his meaning. The truth was that Hannibal had noticed that the
broad street, which was at once within the wall separating the
town from the citadel, and led from the harbour into the open
sea, was well suited for the purpose; and he had conceived the
idea of dragging the ships out of the harbour to the sea on
the southern side of the town. Upon his disclosing his idea to
the Tarentines, they not only expressed their agreement with
the proposal, but the greatest admiration for himself; and made
up their minds that there was nothing which his acuteness and
daring could not accomplish. Trucks on wheels were quickly
constructed: and it was scarcely sooner said than done, owing
to the zeal of the people and the numbers who helped to work
at it. In this way the Tarentines dragged their ships across
into the open sea, and were enabled without danger to themselves
to blockade the Romans on the citadel, having deprived
them of their supplies from without. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;212-211.</span>But Hannibal himself,
leaving a garrison for the city, started with his
army, and returned in a three days&#8217; march to his
original camp; and there remained without further movements
for the rest of the winter....</p>

<h3>FALL OF SYRACUSE, B.C. 212</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">The method taken
by a Roman to estimate
the height
of the wall of Syracuse.
Livy, 25, 23.</span>
<a name="b8_37" id="b8_37"><b>37.</b></a> He counted the layers; for as the
tower had been built of regular layers of
stone, it was very easy to reckon the height
of the battlements from the ground....</p>

<p>Some days afterwards on information being given by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
deserter that the Syracusans had been engaged in a public
sacrifice to Artemis for the last three days; <span class="sidenote">Fall of Syracuse
by an escalade,
autumn <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;212.
Livy, 24, 23-31.</span>
and
that they were using very scanty food in the
festival though plenty of wine, both Epicydes and
certain Syracusans having given a large supply;
Marcus Marcellus selected a part of the wall somewhat lower
than the rest, and thinking it probable that the men were
drunk, owing to the license of the hour, and the short supply of
food with their wine, he determined to attempt an escalade.
Two ladders of the proper height for the wall having been
quickly made, he pressed on the undertaking. He spoke
openly to those who were fit to make the ascent and to face
the first and most conspicuous risk, holding out to them
brilliant prospects of reward. He also picked out some men
to give them necessary help and bring ladders, without telling
them anything except to bid them be ready to obey
orders. His directions having been accurately obeyed, at
the proper time in the night he put the first men in motion,
sending with them the men with the ladders together with a
maniple and a tribune, and having first reminded them of the
rewards awaiting them if they behaved with gallantry. After
this he got his whole force ready to start; and despatching the
vanguard by maniples at intervals, when a thousand had been
massed in this way, after a short pause, he marched himself
with the main body. The men carrying the ladders having
succeeded in safely placing them against the wall, those who
had been told off to make the ascent mounted at once without
hesitation. Having accomplished this without being observed,
and having got a firm footing on the top of the wall,
the rest began to mount by the ladders also, not in any fixed
order, but as best they could. At first as they made their way
upon the wall they found no one to oppose them, for the
guards of the several towers, owing to it being a time of public
sacrifice, were either still drinking or were gone to sleep again
in a state of drunkenness. Consequently of the first and second
companies of guards, which they came upon, they killed the
greater number before they knew that they were being attacked.
And when they came near Hexapyli, they descended from the
wall, and forced open the first postern they came to which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
let into the wall, through which they admitted the general and
the rest of the army. This is the way in which the Romans
took Syracuse....</p>

<h2>BOOK IX</h2>

<h3>EXTRACT FROM THE PREFACE</h3>

<p><a name="b9_1" id="b9_1"><b>1.</b></a> <span class="smcap">Such</span> are the most conspicuous transactions of this
Olympiad, that is, of the four years which an <span class="sidenote">142d Olympiad,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;212-208.</span>
Olympiad must be reckoned to contain; and I
shall endeavour to include the history of them
in two books.</p>

<p>I am quite aware that my history has an element of
austerity in it, and is adapted to, and will be approved by
only one class of readers, owing to the uniformity of its plan.
Nearly all other historians, or at any rate most, attract a
variety of readers by entering upon all the various branches of
history. The curious reader is attracted by the genealogical
style; the antiquarian by the discussion of colonisations,
origins of cities, and ties of blood, such as is found in
Ephorus; the student of polities by the story of tribes, cities,
and dynasties. It is to this last branch of the subject that I
have had a single eye, and have devoted my whole work; and
accordingly have, as I said before, accommodated all my
plans to one particular class of narrative. The result is that I
have made my work by no means attractive reading to the
majority. Why I thus neglected other departments of history,
and deliberately resolved to confine myself to chronicling
actions, I have already stated at length; however, there is
no reason why I should not briefly remind my readers
of it again in this place, for the sake of impressing it upon
them.</p>

<p><a name="b9_2" id="b9_2"><b>2.</b></a> Seeing that many writers have discussed in many
varieties of style the question of genealogies, myths, and
colonisations, as well as of the foundations of cities and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
consanguinity of peoples, there was nothing left for a writer at
this date but to copy the words of others and claim them as his
own,&mdash;than which nothing could be more dishonourable; or,
if he did not choose to do that, to absolutely waste his labour,
being obliged to acknowledge that he is composing a history
and bestowing thought on what has already been sufficiently set
forth and transmitted to posterity by his predecessors. For
these and sundry other reasons I abandoned such themes as
these, and determined on writing a history of actions: first,
because they are continually new and require a new narrative,&mdash;as
of course one generation cannot give us the history of
the next; and secondly, because such a narrative is of all
others the most instructive. This it has always been: but it
is eminently so now, because the arts and sciences have made
such an advance in our day, that students are able to arrange
every event as it happens according to fixed rules, as it were,
of scientific classification. Therefore, as I did not aim so
much at giving pleasure to my readers, as at profiting those
who apply to such studies, I omitted all other themes and
devoted myself wholly to this. But on these points, those who
give a careful attention to my narrative will be the best
witnesses to the truth of what I say....</p>

<h3>THE HANNIBALIAN WAR</h3>

<p><i>In the previous year (212 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) Syracuse had fallen: the
two Scipios had been conquered and killed in Spain: the siege-works
had been constructed round Capua, at the very time of the
fall of Syracuse, i.e. in the autumn, Hannibal being engaged in
fruitless attempts upon the citadel of Tarentum. See Livy,
25, 22.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><a name="b9_3" id="b9_3"><b>3.</b></a> Entirely surrounding the position of Appius Claudius,

battle. But as no one attended to him, his
attack became very like an attempt to storm
the camp; for his cavalry charged in their
squadrons, and with loud cries hurled their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
javelins inside the entrenchments, and the
infantry attacked in their regular companies,
and tried to pull down the palisading round
the camp. But not even so could he move the
Romans from their purpose: they employed
their light-armed troops to repulse those who
were actually attacking the palisade, but protecting
themselves with their heavy shields
against the javelins of the enemy, they remained
drawn up near their standards without moving.
Discomfited at being neither able to throw himself into Capua,
nor induce the Romans to leave their camp, Hannibal retired
to consult as to what was best to be done.</p>

<p>It is no wonder, in my opinion, that the Carthaginians
were puzzled. I think any one who heard
the facts would be the same. <span class="sidenote">The determination
and cautious
tactics of the
Romans.</span>
For who would
not have received with incredulity the statement
that the Romans, after losing so many battles to
the Carthaginians, and though they did not venture to meet
them on the field, could not nevertheless be induced to give
up the contest or abandon the command of the country?
Up to this time, moreover, they had contented themselves
with hovering in his neighbourhood, keeping along the skirts
of the mountains; but now they had taken up a position on
the plains, and those the fairest in all Italy, and were besieging
the strongest city in it; and that with an enemy attacking
them, whom they could not endure even the thought of
meeting face to face: while the Carthaginians, who beyond
all dispute had won the battles, were sometimes in as great
difficulties as the losers. I think the reason of the strategy
adopted by the two sides respectively was, that they both had
seen that Hannibal&#8217;s cavalry was the main cause of the
Carthaginian victory and Roman defeat. Accordingly the
plan of the losers after the battles, of following their enemies
at a distance, was the natural one to adopt; for the country
through which they went was such that the enemy&#8217;s cavalry
would be unable to do them any damage. Similarly what
now happened at Capua to either side was natural and
inevitable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b9_4" id="b9_4"><b>4.</b></a> For the Roman army did not venture to come out
and give battle, from fear of the enemy&#8217;s
horse, <span class="sidenote">Carthaginian
difficulties.</span>
but remained resolutely within their
entrenchment; well knowing that the cavalry,
by which they had been worsted in the battles, could not
hurt them there. While the Carthaginians, again, naturally
could not remain any longer encamped with their cavalry,
because all the pastures in the surrounding country had been
utterly destroyed by the Romans with that very view; and it was
impossible for animals to come from such a distance, carrying
on their backs hay and barley for so large a body of cavalry,
and so many beasts of burden; nor again did they venture,
when encamped without their cavalry, to attack an enemy
protected by a palisade and fosse, with whom a contest, even
without these advantages in their favour, was likely to be a
doubtful one if they had not got their cavalry. Besides this
they were much alarmed about the new Consuls, lest they
should come and encamp against them, and reduce them to
serious straits by cutting off their supplies of provisions.</p>

<p>These considerations convinced Hannibal that it was
impossible to raise the siege by an open attack,
and he therefore changed his tactics. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal determines
on creating
a diversion by
threatening
Rome.</span>
He
imagined that if by a secret march he could
suddenly appear in the neighbourhood of Rome,
he might by the alarm which he would inspire
in the inhabitants by his unexpected movement, perhaps do
something worth while against the city itself; or, if he could not
do that, would at least force Appius either to raise the siege of
Capua, in order to hasten to the relief of his native town, or
to divide the Roman forces; which would then be easier for
him to conquer in detail.</p>

<p><a name="b9_5" id="b9_5"><b>5.</b></a> With this purpose in his mind he sent a letter-carrier
into Capua. This he did by persuading one of
his Libyans to desert to the Roman camp, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal informs
the Capuans of
his purpose.</span>
and
thence to Capua. He took this trouble to
secure the safe delivery of his letter, because he was very
much afraid that the Capuans, if they saw him departing,
would consider that he despaired of them, and would therefore
give up hope and surrender to the Romans. He wrote therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
an explanation of his design, and sent the Libyan the day
after, in order that the Capuans, being acquainted with the
purpose of his departure, might go on courageously sustaining
the siege.</p>

<p>When the news had arrived at Rome that Hannibal had
encamped over against their lines, <span class="sidenote">Excitement and
activity at Rome.</span>
and was
actually besieging their forces, there was
universal excitement and terror, from a
feeling that the result of the impending battle would
decide the whole war. Consequently, with one heart and
soul, the citizens had all devoted themselves to sending out
reinforcements and making preparations for this struggle. On
their part, the Capuans were encouraged by the receipt of
Hannibal&#8217;s letter, and by thus learning the object of the
Carthaginian movement, to stand by their determination, and
to await the issue of this new hope. At the end of the fifth day,
therefore, after his arrival on the ground, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal starts.</span>
Hannibal ordered his
men to take their supper as usual, and leave
their watch-fires burning; and started with such
secrecy, that none of the enemy knew what was happening.
He took the road through Samnium, and marched at a great
pace and without stopping, his skirmishers always keeping
before him to reconnoitre and occupy all the posts along the
route: and while those in Rome had their thoughts still wholly
occupied with Capua and the campaign there, he crossed the
Anio without being observed; and having arrived at a distance
of not more than forty stades from Rome, there pitched
his camp.</p>

<p><a name="b9_6" id="b9_6"><b>6.</b></a> On this being known at Rome, the utmost confusion
and terror prevailed among the inhabitants,&mdash;this
movement of Hannibal&#8217;s being as unexpected
as it was sudden; <span class="sidenote">Terror at
Rome.</span>
for he had never
been so close to the city before. At the same time their
alarm was increased by the idea at once occurring to them,
that he would not have ventured so near, if it were not that
the armies at Capua were destroyed. Accordingly, the men
at once went to line the walls, and the points of vantage in the
defences of the town; while the women went round to the
temples of the gods and implored their protection, sweeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
the pavements of the temples with their hair: for this is their
customary way of behaving when any serious danger comes
upon their country. But just as Hannibal had encamped,
and was intending to attempt the city itself next day, an
extraordinary coincidence occurred which proved fortunate
for the preservation of Rome.</p>

<p>For Gnaeus Fulvius and Publius Sulpicius, having already
enrolled one consular army, had bound the men <span class="sidenote">The Consular
levies fortunately
being at Rome
enable the
Romans to make
a counter-demonstration.</span>
with the usual oath to appear at Rome armed on
that very day; and were also engaged on that day
in drawing out the lists and testing the men for
the other army:<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> whereby it so happened that a
large number of men had been collected in Rome
spontaneously in the very nick of time. These troops the
Consuls boldly led outside the walls, and, entrenching themselves
there, checked Hannibal&#8217;s intended movement. For the
Carthaginians were at first eager to advance, and were not
altogether without hope that they would be able to take Rome
itself by assault. But when they saw the enemy drawn up in
order, and learnt before long from a prisoner what had
happened, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal
devastates the
Campagna.</span>
they abandoned the idea of attacking
the city, and began devastating the country-side
instead, and setting fire to the houses. In
these first raids they collected an innumerable amount of booty,
for the field of plunder upon which they were entered was
one into which no one had ever expected an enemy to set
foot.</p>

<p><a name="b9_7" id="b9_7"><b>7.</b></a> But presently, when the Consuls ventured to encamp
within ten stades of him, Hannibal broke up his
quarters before daylight. <span class="sidenote">Hannibal
starts on his
return.</span>
He did so for three
reasons:&mdash;first, because he had collected an
enormous booty; secondly, because he had given up all hope
of taking Rome; and lastly, because he reckoned that the
time had now come at which he expected, according to
his original idea, that Appius would have learnt the danger
threatening Rome, and would have raised the siege of Capua<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
and come with his whole force to the relief of the city; or at
any rate would hurry up with the greater part, leaving a detachment
to carry on the siege. Publius had caused the bridges
over the Anio to be broken down, and thus compelled
Hannibal to get his army across by a ford; <span class="sidenote">The passage of
the Anio.</span>
and
he now attacked the Carthaginians as they were
engaged in making the passage of the stream
and caused them great distress. They were not able however
to strike an important blow, owing to the number of Hannibal&#8217;s
cavalry, and the activity of the Numidians in every part of the
field. But before retiring to their camp they wrested the
greater part of the booty from them, and killed about three
hundred men; and then, being convinced that the Carthaginians
were beating a hasty retreat in a panic, they followed
in their rear, keeping along the line of hills. At first Hannibal
continued to march at a rapid pace, being anxious to meet the
force which he expected; but at the end of the fifth day,
being informed that Appius had not left the
siege of Capua, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal
turns upon his
pursuers.</span>
he halted; and waiting for the
enemy to come up, made an attack upon his
camp before daylight, killed a large number of them, and drove
the rest out of their camp. But when day broke, and he saw
the Romans in a strong position upon a steep hill, to which
they had retired, he decided not to continue his attack upon
them; but marching through Daunia and Bruttium he
appeared at Rhegium, so unexpectedly, that he was within an
ace of capturing the city, and did cut off all who were out in
the country; and during this excursion captured a very large
number of the Rhegini.</p>

<p><a name="b9_8" id="b9_8"><b>8.</b></a> It seems to me that the courage and determination both
of the Carthaginians and Romans at this crisis were truly remarkable;
and merit quite as much admiration as the conduct
of Epaminondas, which I will describe here for the sake of
pointing the comparison.</p>

<p>He reached Tegea with the allies, and when he saw that
the Lacedaemonians with their own forces in <span class="sidenote">The rapid march

full were come to Mantinea, and that their allies
had mustered together in the same city, with the
intention of offering the Thebans battle; having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Xenophon, <i>Hell.</i>

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;362.</span>
given orders to his men to get their supper
early, he led his army out immediately after
nightfall, on the pretext of being anxious to
seize certain posts with a view to the coming battle. But
having impressed this idea upon the common soldiers, he led
them along the road to Lacedaemon itself; and having arrived
at the city about the third hour of his march, contrary to all
expectation, and finding Sparta destitute of defenders, he
forced his way right up to the market-place, and occupied the
quarters of the town which slope down to the river. <span class="sidenote">A Cretan warns
Agesilaus.</span>Then
however a contretemps occurred: a deserter
made his way into Mantinea and told Agesilaus
what was going on. Assistance accordingly
arrived just as the city was on the point of being taken; and
Epaminondas was disappointed of his hope. But having
caused his men to get their breakfast along the bank of the
Eurotas, and recovered them from their fatigue, he started to
march back again by the same road, calculating that, as the
Lacedaemonians and their allies had come to the relief of
Sparta, Mantinea would in its turn be left undefended: which
turned out to be the case. So he exhorted the Thebans to
exert themselves; and, after a rapid night march, arrived at
Mantinea about midday, finding it entirely destitute of
defenders.</p>

<p>But the Athenians, who were at that time zealously supporting
the Lacedaemonians in their contest with the Thebans, had
arrived in virtue of their treaty of alliance; and just as the
Theban vanguard reached the temple of Poseidon, seven stades
from the town, it happened that the Athenians showed themselves,
by design, as if on the brow of the hill overhanging
Mantinea. And when they saw them, the Mantineans who
had been left behind at last ventured to man the wall and
resist the attack of the Thebans. Therefore historians are
justified in speaking with some dissatisfaction of these events,<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>
when they say that the leader did everything which a good
general could, but that, while conquering his enemies, Epaminondas
was conquered by Fortune.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span></p>

<p><a name="b9_9" id="b9_9"><b>9.</b></a> Much the same remark applies to Hannibal. For who
can refrain from regarding with respect and admiration a
general capable of doing what he did? First he attempted by
harassing the enemy with skirmishing attacks to raise the siege:
having failed in this he made direct for Rome itself: baffled
once more by a turn of fortune entirely independent of human
calculation, he kept his pursuers in play,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> and waited till the
moment was ripe to see whether the besiegers of Capua
stirred: and finally, without relaxing in his determination, swept
down upon his enemies to their destruction, and all but
depopulated Rhegium. One would be inclined however to
judge the Romans to be superior to the Lacedaemonians at this
crisis. For the Lacedaemonians rushed off <i>en masse</i> at the
first message and relieved Sparta, but, as far as they were
concerned, lost Mantinea. The Romans guarded their own
city without breaking up the siege of Capua: on the contrary,
they remained unshaken and firm in their purpose, and in fact
from that time pressed the Capuans with renewed spirit.</p>

<p>I have not said this for the sake of making a panegyric on
either the Romans or Carthaginians, whose great qualities I
have already remarked upon more than once: but for the sake
of those who are in office among the one or the other people, or
who are in future times to direct the affairs of any state whatever;
that by the memory, or actual contemplation, of exploits
such as these they may be inspired with emulation. For in an
adventurous and hazardous policy it often turns out that
audacity was the truest safety and the finest sagacity;<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> and
success or failure does not affect the credit and excellence of
the original design, so long as the measures taken are the result
of deliberate thought....</p>

relief with a very large force; and being unable
to afford efficient aid to those in the town,
owing to the strict blockade maintained by the
Romans, without meaning to do so he used up
more than he brought; and so after having
been constrained by entreaties and large
promises to come, he was afterwards forced at
the earnest supplication of the people to depart....</p>

<h3>THE SPOILS OF SYRACUSE</h3>

<p><a name="b9_10" id="b9_10"><b>10.</b></a> A city is not really adorned by what is brought from
without, but by the virtue of its own inhabitants....</p>

<p>The Romans, then, decided to transfer these things to their
own city and to leave nothing behind. <span class="sidenote">Syracuse was
taken in the
autumn, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;212.
&#8220;The ornaments

Livy, 25, 40, cp.
26, 21.</span>
Whether
they were right in doing so, and consulted their
true interests or the reverse, is a matter admitting
of much discussion; but I think the balance of
argument is in favour of believing it to have been
wrong then, and wrong now. If such had been
the works by which they had exalted their
country, it is clear that there would have been
some reason in transferring thither the things by which they
had become great. But the fact was that, while leading lives
of the greatest simplicity themselves, as far as possible removed
from the luxury and extravagance which these things
imply, they yet conquered the men who had always possessed
them in the greatest abundance and of the finest quality. Could
there have been a greater mistake than theirs? Surely it
would be an incontestable error for a people to abandon the
habits of the conquerors and adopt those of the conquered;
and at the same time involve itself in that jealousy which is the
most dangerous concomitant of excessive prosperity. For the
looker-on never congratulates those who take what belongs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
to others, without a feeling of jealousy mingling with his pity for
the losers. But suppose such prosperity to go on increasing, and
a people to accumulate into its own hands all the possessions
of the rest of the world, and moreover to invite in a way the
plundered to share in the spectacle they present, in that case
surely the mischief is doubled. For it is no longer a case of
the spectators pitying their neighbours, but themselves, as they
recall the ruin of their own country. Such a sight produces
an outburst, not of jealousy merely, but of rage against the
victors. For the reminder of their own disaster serves to enhance
their hatred of the authors of it. To sweep the gold and silver,
however, into their own coffers was perhaps reasonable; for it
was impossible for them to aim at universal empire without
crippling the means of the rest of the world, and securing the
same kind of resources for themselves. But they might have
left in their original sites things that had nothing to do with
material wealth; and thus at the same time have avoided
exciting jealousy, and raised the reputation of their country:
adorning it, not with pictures and statues, but with dignity of
character and greatness of soul. I have spoken thus much as
a warning to those who take upon themselves to rule over
others, that they may not imagine that, when they pillage cities,
the misfortunes of others are an honour to their own country.
The Romans, however, when they transferred these things to
Rome, used such of them as belonged to individuals to increase
the splendour of private establishments, and such as belonged
to the state to adorn the city....</p>

<h3>ON THE ART OF COMMANDING ARMIES</h3>

<p><a name="b9_12" id="b9_12"><b>12.</b></a> The chances and accidents that attend military expeditions
require great circumspection; and it is possible to
provide for all of them with precision, provided that a man
gives his mind to the conduct of his plan of campaign. Now
that fewer operations in war are carried out openly and by
mere force, than by stratagem and the skillful use of opportunity,
any one that chooses may readily learn from the history
of the past. And again that operations depending on the
choice of opportunity oftener fail than succeed is easily proved
from experience. Nor can there be any doubt that the greater
part of such failures are due to the folly or carelessness of the
leaders. It is time therefore to inquire into the rules of this
art of strategy.</p>

<p>Such things as occur in campaigns without having been
calculated upon in any way we must not speak of as operations,
but as accidents or casualties. It is the conduct of a campaign
in accordance with an exact plan that I am to set forth:
omitting all such things as do not fall under a scientific rule,
and have no fixed design.</p>

<p><a name="b9_13" id="b9_13"><b>13.</b></a> Every operation requires a time fixed for its commencement,
a period and place for its execution, <span class="sidenote">The points of
inherent importance
in the
conduct of a
campaign,&mdash;time,
place, secrecy,
code of signals,
agents, and
method.</span>
secrecy, definite signals, persons by whom and
with whom it is to be executed, and a settled plan
for conducting it. It is evident that the man
who has rightly provided for each of these details
will not fail in the ultimate result, while he who
has neglected any single one of them will fail in
the whole. Such is the order of nature, that one insignificant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
circumstance will suffice for failure, while for success rigid
perfection of every detail is barely enough.</p>

<p>Leaders then should neglect no single point in conducting
such expeditions.</p>

<p>Now the head and front of such precautions is silence; and
not to allow either joy at the appearance of an
unexpected hope, or fear, or familiarity, <span class="sidenote">Things necessary.
1. Silence.</span>
or
natural affection, to induce a man to communicate
his plans to any one unconcerned, but to impart it
to those and those alone without whom it is impossible to
complete his plan, and not even to them a moment sooner
than necessary, but only when the exigencies of the particular
service make it inevitable. It is necessary, moreover, not only
to be silent with the tongue, but much more so in the mind.
For it has happened to many generals before now, while
preserving an inviolable silence, to betray their thoughts
either by the expression of their countenances or by their
actions.</p>

<p>The second requisite is to know accurately the conditions
under which marches by day or night may be <span class="sidenote">2. Knowledge of
the capabilities of
the force in
moving.</span>
performed, and the distances to which they can
extend, and not only marches on land, but also
voyages by sea.</p>

<p>The third and most important is to have some knowledge
of the seasons, and to be able to adapt the design to them.</p>

<p>Nor again is the selection of the ground for the operation
to be regarded as unimportant, since it often happens that it
is this which makes what seems impossible possible, and what
seemed possible impossible.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">3. Care in concerting
signals.<br />4. Care in selecting
men.</span>Finally there must be no neglect of the
subject of signals and counter signals; and the
choice of persons by whom and with whom the
operation is to be carried out.</p>

<p><a name="b9_14" id="b9_14"><b>14.</b></a> Of these points some are learnt by experience, some
from history, and others by the study of
scientific strategy. <span class="sidenote">5. Knowledge of
localities.</span>
It is a most excellent thing
too that the general should have a personal
knowledge both of the roads, and the locality which he has
to reach, and its natural features, as well as of the persons by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
whom and with whom he is to act. If that is not possible, the
next best thing is that he should make careful inquiries and
not trust just any one: and men who undertake to act as
guides to such places should always deposit security with
those whom they are conducting.</p>

<p>These, and other points like them, it is perhaps possible
that leaders may learn sufficiently from the mere
study of strategy, <span class="sidenote">6. Accurate knowledge
of natural
phenomena enabling
a general
to make accurate
calculation of time.</span>
whether practical or in books.
But scientific investigation requires scientific
processes and demonstrations, especially in
astronomy and geometry; the working out of
which is not much to our present point, though
their results are important, and may contribute largely to the
success of such undertakings.</p>

<p>The most important operation in astronomy is the calculation
of the lengths of the days and nights. If these had been
uniform it would not have been a matter requiring any study,
but the knowledge would have been common to all the world:
since however they not only differ with each other but also
with themselves, it is plainly necessary to be acquainted with
the increase and diminution of both the one and the other.
How can a man calculate a march, and the distance practicable
in a day or in a night, if he is unacquainted with the variation of
these periods of time? In fact nothing can be done up to time
without this knowledge,&mdash;it is inevitable otherwise that a man
should be sometimes too late and sometimes too soon. And
these operations are the only ones in which being too soon is a
worse fault than being too late. For the general who overstays
the proper hour of action only misses his chance, since he can
find out that he has done so before he arrives, and so get off
safely: but he that anticipates the hour is detected when he
comes up; and so not only misses his immediate aim, but runs
a risk of ruining himself altogether.</p>

<p><a name="b9_15" id="b9_15"><b>15.</b></a> In all human undertakings opportuneness is the most
important thing, but especially in operations of war. Therefore
a general must have at his fingers&#8217; ends the season of the
summer and winter solstice, the equinoxes, and the periods
between them in which the days and nights increase and
diminish. For it is by this knowledge alone that he can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
compute the distance that can be done whether by sea or
land. Again, he must necessarily understand <span class="sidenote">The divisions of
the day;</span>
the subdivisions both of the day and
the night, in order to know at what hour to
order the reveill&eacute;, or the march out; for the end cannot be
attained unless the beginning be rightly taken. As for the
periods of the day, they may be observed by the shadows or
by the sun&#8217;s course, and the quarter of the heaven in which
it has arrived, but it is difficult to do the same for the
night, unless a man is familiar with the phenomenon
of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, <span class="sidenote">of the night.</span>
and their law and order: and this is easy to those who
have studied astronomy. For since, though the nights are
unequal in length, at least six of the signs of the Zodiac are
nevertheless above the horizon every night, it is plain that in
the same portions of every night equal portions of the twelve
signs of the Zodiac rise. Now as it is known what portion of
the sphere is occupied by the sun during the day, it is evident
that when he has set the arc subtended by the diameter of
his arc must rise. Therefore the length of the night is exactly
commensurate with the portion of the Zodiac which appears
above the horizon after sunset. And, given that we know the
number and size of the signs of the Zodiac, the corresponding
divisions of the night are also known. If however the nights
be cloudy, the moon must be watched, since owing to its size
its light as a general rule is always visible, at whatsoever point
in the heaven it may be. The hour may be guessed sometimes
by observing the time and place of its rising, or again of
its setting, if you only have sufficient acquaintance with this
phenomenon to be familiar with the daily variation of its rising.
And the law which it too follows admits of being easily
observed; for its revolution is limited by the period of one
month, which serves as a model to which all subsequent
revolutions conform.</p>

<p><a name="b9_16" id="b9_16"><b>16.</b></a> And here one may mention with admiration that
Homer represents Ulysses, that truest type of
a leader of men, <span class="sidenote">The example of
Ulysses. See
Odyss. 5, 270 <i>sq.</i></span>
taking observations of the
stars, not only to direct his voyages, but his operations
on land also. For such accidents as baffle expectation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
and are incapable of being accurately reckoned upon, are
quite sufficient to bring us to great and frequent distress,
for instance, downpours of rain and rise of torrents, excessive
frosts and snows, misty and cloudy weather, and other things
like these;&mdash;but if we also neglect to provide for those which
can be foreseen, is it not likely that we shall have ourselves
to thank for frequent failures? None of these means then
must be neglected, if we wish to avoid those errors into which
many others are said to have fallen, as well as the particular
generals whom I am about to mention by way of examples.</p>

<p><a name="b9_17" id="b9_17"><b>17.</b></a> When Aratus, the Strategus of the Achaean league,
attempted to take Cynaetha by treachery, <span class="sidenote">Aratus fails at
Cynaetha.</span>
he
arranged a day with those in the town who
were co-operating with him, on which he was to arrive on the
banks of the river which flows past Cynaetha, and to remain
there quietly with his forces: while the party inside the town
about midday, when they got an opportunity, were to send
out one of their men quietly, wrapped in a cloak, and order
him to take his stand upon a tomb agreed upon in front of
the city; the rest were to attack the officers who were accustomed
to guard the gate while taking their siesta. This being
done, the Achaeans were to rise from their ambush and to
make all haste to occupy the gate. These arrangements
made, and the time having come, Aratus arrived; and having
concealed himself down by the river, waited there for the
signal. But about an hour before noon, a man, whose profession
it was to keep a fine kind of sheep near the town,
wishing to ask some business question of the shepherd, came
out of the gate with his cloak on, and standing upon the same
tomb looked round to find the shepherd. Whereupon Aratus,
thinking that the signal had been given, hurried with all his
men as fast as he could towards the gate. But the gate being
hurriedly closed by the guard, owing to no preparations having
yet been made by the party in the town, the result was
that Aratus not only failed in his attempt but was the cause
of the worst misfortunes to his partisans. For being thus
detected they were dragged forward and put to death. What
is one to say was the cause of this catastrophe? Surely that
the general arranged only for a single signal, and being then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
quite young had no experience of the accuracy secured by
double signals and counter-signals. On so small a point in
war does the success or failure of an operation turn.</p>

<p><a name="b9_18" id="b9_18"><b>18.</b></a> Again the Spartan Cleomenes, when proposing to take
Megalopolis by a stratagem, arranged with the <span class="sidenote">Cleomenes.
See <b>2</b>, <a href="#b2_55">55</a>.</span>
guards of that part of the wall near what is called
the Cavern to come out with all their men in the third watch,
the hour at which his partisans were on duty on the wall;
but not having taken into consideration the fact that at the
time of the rising of the Pleiads the nights are
very short, <span class="sidenote">May 12.</span>he started his army from Sparta
about sunset. The result was that he was not able to get
there in time, but being overtaken by daybreak, made a rash
and ill-considered attempt to carry the town, and was repulsed
with considerable loss and the danger of a complete overthrow.
Now if he had, in accordance with his arrangement, hit the
proper time, and led in his men while his partisans were in
command of the entrance, he would not have failed in his
attempt.</p>

<p>Similarly, once more, King Philip, as I have already
stated, when carrying on an intrigue in the
city of Meliteia, <span class="sidenote">Philip&#8217;s attack
on Meliteia.
See <b>5</b>, <a href="#b5_97">97</a>.</span>
made a mistake in two ways.
The ladders which he brought were too short
for their purpose, and he mistook the time. For having
arranged to arrive about midnight, when every one was fast
asleep, he started from Larissa and arrived in the territory of
Meliteia too early, and was neither able to halt, for fear of his
arrival being announced in the city, nor to get back again
without being discovered. Being compelled therefore to continue
his advance, he arrived at the city while the inhabitants
were still awake. Consequently he could neither carry the
wall by an escalade, because of the insufficient length of the
ladders; nor enter by the gate, because it was too early for his
partisans inside to help him. Finally, he did nothing but
irritate the people of the town, and, after losing a considerable
number of his own men, retired unsuccessful and covered with
disgrace; having only given a warning to the rest of the
world to distrust him and be on their guard against him.</p>

<p><a name="b9_19" id="b9_19"><b>19.</b></a> Again Nicias, the general of the Athenians, had it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
his power to have saved the army besieging Syracuse, <span class="sidenote">Nicias, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;413.
Thucyd. 7, 50.</span>and
had selected the proper time of the night
for escaping the observation of the enemy, and
retiring to a place of safety. And then because the moon was
eclipsed, regarding it superstitiously as of evil portent, he
stopped the army from starting. Thanks to this it came
about that, when he started the next day, the enemy had obtained
information of his intention, and army and generals
alike fell into the hands of the Syracusans. Yet if he had
asked about this from men acquainted with such phenomena, he
might not only have avoided missing his opportunity for such
an absurd reason, but have also used the occurrence for his
own benefit owing to the ignorance of the enemy. For the
ignorance of their neighbours contributes more than anything
else to the success of the instructed.</p>

<p>Such then are examples of the necessity of studying celestial
phenomena. But as for securing the proper
length of scaling ladders, <span class="sidenote">The method of
judging of the
length necessary
for
scaling ladders.</span>
the following is the
method of making the calculation. Suppose
the height of the wall to be given by one of the
conspirators within, the measurement required
for the ladders is evident; for example, if the height of the
wall is ten feet or any other unit, the ladders must be full
twelve; and the interval between the wall and the foot of the
ladder must be half the length of the ladder, that the ladders
may not break under the weight of those mounting if they
are set farther away, nor be too steep to be safe if set nearer
the perpendicular. But supposing it not to be possible to
measure or get near the wall: the height of any object which
rises perpendicularly on its base can be taken by those who
choose to study mathematics.</p>

<p><a name="b9_20" id="b9_20"><b>20.</b></a> Once more, therefore, those who wish to succeed in
military projects and operations must have studied geometry,
not with professional completeness, but far enough to have a
comprehension of proportion and equations. For it is not
only in such cases that these are necessary, but also for raising
the scale of the divisions of a camp. For sometimes the
problem is to change the entire form of the camp, and yet to
keep the same proportion between all the parts included: at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
other times to keep the same shape in the parts, and to increase
or diminish the whole area on which the camp stands, adding
or subtracting from all proportionally. On which point I
have already spoken in more elaborate detail in my Notes on
Military Tactics. For I do not think that any one will reasonably
object to me that I add a great burden to strategy, in
urging on those who endeavour to acquire it the study of
astronomy and geometry: for, while rather rejecting all that
is superfluous in these studies, and brought in for show and
talk, as well as all idea of enjoining their prosecution beyond
the point of practical utility, I am most earnest and eager for
so much as is barely necessary. For it would be strange if
those who aim at the sciences of dancing and flute-playing
should study the preparatory sciences of rhythms and music,
(and the like might be said of the pursuits of the palaestra),
from the belief that the final attainment of each of these
sciences requires the assistance of the latter; while the students
of strategy are to feel aggrieved if they find that they require
subsidiary sciences up to a certain point. That would mean
that men practising common and inferior arts are more diligent
and energetic than those who resolve to excel in the best
and most dignified subject, which no man of sense would
admit....</p>

<h3>THE COMPUTATION OF THE SIZE OF CITIES</h3>

<p><a name="b9_21" id="b9_21"><b>21.</b></a> Most people calculate the area merely from the
length of the circumference [of towns or
camps]. <span class="sidenote">Sparta and
Megalopolis.</span>
Accordingly, when one says that
the city of Megalopolis has a circuit of fifty
stades, and that of Sparta forty-eight, but that Sparta is twice
the size of Megalopolis, they look upon the assertion as incredible.
And if one, by way of increasing the difficulty, were
to say that a city or camp may have a circuit of forty stades
and yet be double the size of one having a perimeter of a
hundred, the statement would utterly puzzle them. The
reason of this is that we do not remember the lessons in
geometry taught us at school. I was led to make these
remarks because it is not only common people, but actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
some statesmen and military commanders, who have puzzled
themselves sometimes by wondering whether it were possible
that Sparta should be bigger, and that too by a great deal,
than Megalopolis, while having a shorter circuit; and at other
times by trying to conjecture the number of men by considering
the mere length of a camp&#8217;s circuit. A similar mistake
is also made in pronouncing as to the number of the inhabitants
of cities. For most people imagine that cities in which
the ground is broken and hilly contain more houses than a
flat site. But the fact is not so; because houses are built at
right angles not to sloping foundations but to the plains below,
upon which the hills themselves are excrescences. And this
admits of a proof within the intelligence of a child. For if
one would imagine houses on slopes to be raised until they
were of the same height; it is evident that the plane of the
roofs of the houses thus united will be equal and parallel
to the plane underlying the hills and foundations.</p>

<p>So much for those who aspire to be leaders and statesmen and
are yet ignorant and puzzled about such facts as these....</p>

<p>Those who do not enter upon undertakings with good will
and zeal cannot be expected to give real help when the time
comes to act....</p>

<h3>THE HANNIBALIAN WAR, B.C. 211</h3>

<p>Such being the position of the Romans and Carthaginians,
Fortune continually oscillating between the two, we may say
with the poet</p>

<p>There is profound truth in the observation which I have
often made, that it is impossible to grasp or get a complete
view of the fairest of all subjects of contemplation, the tendency
of history as a whole, from writers of partial histories....</p>

<h3>THE CHARACTER OF HANNIBAL</h3>

<p><a name="b9_22" id="b9_22"><b>22.</b></a> Of all that befell the Romans and Carthaginians, good
or bad, the cause was one man and one mind,&mdash;Hannibal.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span></p>
<p>For it is notorious that he managed the Italian campaigns in
person, and the Spanish by the agency of the elder of his
brothers, Hasdrubal, and subsequently by that of Mago, the
leaders who killed the two Roman generals in Spain about the
same time. Again, he conducted the Sicilian campaign at
first through Hippocrates and afterwards through Myttonus<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
the Libyan. So also in Greece and Illyria: and, by brandishing
before their faces the dangers arising from these latter
places, he was enabled to distract the attention of the Romans,
thanks to his understanding with Philip. So great and wonderful
is the influence of a Man, and a mind duly fitted by
original constitution for any undertaking within the reach of
human powers.</p>

<p>But since the position of affairs has brought us to an
inquiry into the genius of Hannibal, the occasion seems to
me to demand that I should explain in regard to him the
peculiarities of his character which have been especially the
subject of controversy. Some regard him as having been
extraordinarily cruel, some exceedingly grasping of money.
But to speak the truth of him, or of any person engaged in
public affairs, is not easy. Some maintain that men&#8217;s real
natures are brought out by their circumstances, and that they
are detected when in office, <span class="sidenote">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945; &#948;&#949;&#8055;&#958;&#949;&#953;.
Bias, in Aristot.
Eth. 5, 1.</span>
or as some say when
in misfortunes, though they have up to that time
completely maintained their secrecy. I, on the
contrary, do not regard this as a sound dictum. For I think
that men in these circumstances are compelled, not only
occasionally but frequently, either by the suggestions of friends
or the complexity of affairs, to speak and act contrary to their
real principles.</p>

<p><a name="b9_23" id="b9_23"><b>23.</b></a> And there are many proofs of this to be found in past
history if any one will give the necessary
attention. <span class="sidenote">Examples to the
contrary.
1. Agathocles.</span>
Is it not universally stated by
the historians that Agathocles, tyrant of
Sicily, after having the reputation of extreme cruelty in his
original measures for the establishment of his dynasty, when
he had once become convinced that his power over the
Siceliots was firmly established, is considered to have become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
the most humane and mild of rulers? <span class="sidenote">2. Cleomenes.</span>
Again, was not
Cleomenes of Sparta a most excellent king, a
most cruel tyrant, and then again as a private
individual most obliging and benevolent? And yet it is not
reasonable to suppose the most opposite dispositions to exist
in the same nature. They are compelled to change with the
changes of circumstances: and so some rulers often display to
the world a disposition as opposite as possible to their true
nature. Therefore the natures of men not only are not brought
out by such things, but on the contrary are rather obscured.
The same effect is produced also not only in commanders,
despots, and kings, but in states also, by the suggestions of
friends. <span class="sidenote">3. Athens.</span>For instance, you will find the
Athenians responsible for very few tyrannical
acts, and of many kindly and noble ones, while Aristeides and
Pericles were at the head of the state: but quite the reverse
when Cleon and Chares were so. <span class="sidenote">4. Sparta.</span>
And when the Lacedaemonians
were supreme in Greece, all the
measures taken by King Cleombrotus were
conceived in the interests of their allies, but those by
Agesilaus not so. <span class="sidenote">5. Philip V.</span>
The characters of states therefore vary
with the variations of their leaders. King
Philip again, when Taurion and Demetrius
were acting with him, was most impious in his conduct, but
when Aratus or Chrysogonus, most humane.</p>

<p><a name="b9_24" id="b9_24"><b>24.</b></a> The case of Hannibal seems to me to be on a par
with these. His circumstances were so extraordinary
and shifting, <span class="sidenote">Hannibal
mastered by circumstances.</span>
his closest friends
so widely different, that it is exceedingly
difficult to estimate his character from his proceedings
in Italy. What those circumstances suggested to him may
easily be understood from what I have already said, and what
is immediately to follow; but it is not right to omit the
suggestions made by his friends either, especially as this
matter may be rendered sufficiently clear by one instance of
the advice offered him. At the time that Hannibal was
meditating the march from Iberia to Italy with his army,
he was confronted with the extreme difficulty of providing
food and securing provisions, both because the journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
was thought to be of insuperable length, and because the
barbarians that lived in the intervening country were so
numerous and savage. <span class="sidenote">His cruelty.</span>
It appears that at that time this
difficulty frequently came on for discussion at
the council; and that one of his friends, called
Hannibal Monomachus, gave it as his opinion that there was
one and only one way by which it was possible to get as far as
Italy. Upon Hannibal bidding him speak out, he said that
they must teach the army to eat human flesh, and make them
accustomed to it. Hannibal could say nothing against the
boldness and effectiveness of the idea, but was unable to persuade
himself or his friends to entertain it. It is this man&#8217;s
acts in Italy that they say were attributed to Hannibal, to
maintain the accusation of cruelty, as well as such as were the
result of circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="b9_25" id="b9_25"><b>25.</b></a> Fond of money indeed he does seem to have
been to a conspicuous degree, and to have
had a friend of the same character&mdash;Mago, <span class="sidenote">His avarice.</span>
who commanded in Bruttium. That account I got from
the Carthaginians themselves; for natives know best not
only which way the wind lies, as the proverb has it, but
the characters also of their fellow-countrymen. But I
heard a still more detailed story from Massanissa, who
maintained the charge of money-loving against all Carthaginians
generally, but especially against Hannibal and Mago
called the Samnite. Among other stories, he told me that
these two men had arranged a most generous subdivision of
operations between each other from their earliest youth; and
though they had each taken a very large number of cities in
Iberia and Italy by force or fraud, they had never taken part in
the same operation together; but had always schemed against
each other, more than against the enemy, in order to prevent
the one being with the other at the taking of a city: that they
might neither quarrel in consequence of things of this sort,
nor have to divide the profit on the ground of their equality
of rank.</p>

<p><a name="b9_26" id="b9_26"><b>26.</b></a> The influence of friends then, and still more that of
circumstances, in doing violence to and changing the natural
character of Hannibal, is shown by what I have narrated and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
will be shown by what I have to narrate. For as soon
as Capua fell into the hands of the Romans
the other cities naturally became restless, <span class="sidenote">Effect of the fall
of Capua,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;211.</span>
and began to look round for opportunities
and pretexts for revolting back again to Rome. It
was then that Hannibal seems to have been at his lowest
point of distress and despair. For neither was he able to
keep a watch upon all the cities so widely removed from each
other,&mdash;while he remained entrenched at one spot, and the
enemy were man&oelig;uvering against him with several armies,&mdash;nor
could he divide his force into many parts; for he would
have put an easy victory into the hands of the enemy by
becoming inferior to them in numbers, and finding it impossible
to be personally present at all points. Wherefore he was
obliged to completely abandon some of the cities, and withdraw
his garrisons from others: being afraid lest, in the course
of the revolutions which might occur, he should lose his own
soldiers as well. Some cities again he made up his mind to
treat with treacherous violence, removing their inhabitants to
other cities, and giving their property up to plunder; in
consequence of which many were enraged with him, and
accused him of impiety or cruelty. For the fact was that
these movements were accompanied by robberies of money,
murders, and violence, on various pretexts at the hands of the
outgoing or incoming soldiers in the cities, because they
always supposed that the inhabitants that were left behind
were on the verge of turning over to the enemy. It is, therefore,
very difficult to express an opinion on the natural
character of Hannibal, owing to the influence exercised on it
by the counsel of friends and the force of circumstances. The
prevailing notion about him, however, at Carthage was that
he was greedy of money, at Rome that he was cruel.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a>...</p>

<h3>AGRIGENTUM</h3>

<p><a name="b9_27" id="b9_27"><b>27.</b></a> The city of Agrigentum is not only superior to most
cities in the particulars I have mentioned, <span class="sidenote">Agrigentum taken
by Marcus Valerius
Laevinus,
late in the year
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;210, <i>jam

but
above all in beauty and elaborate ornamentation.
It stands within eighteen stades of the
sea, so that it participates in every advantage
from that quarter; while its circuit of fortification
is particularly strong both by nature and
art. For its wall is placed on a rock, steep and
precipitous, on one side naturally, on the other made so
artificially. And it is enclosed by rivers: for along the south
side runs the river of the same name as the town, and along
the west and south-west side the river called Hypsas. The
citadel overlooks the city exactly at the south-east, girt on the
outside by an impassable ravine, and on the inside with only
one approach from the town. On the top of it is a temple of
Athene and of Zeus Atabyrius as at Rhodes: for as Agrigentum
was founded by the Rhodians, it is natural that this
deity should have the same appellation as at Rhodes. The
city is sumptuously adorned in other respects also with
temples and colonnades. The temple of Zeus Olympius is
still unfinished, but in its plan and dimensions it seems to
be inferior to no temple whatever in all Greece....</p>

<h3>GREECE</h3>

<p><a name="b9_28" id="b9_28"><b>28.</b></a> <i>Speech of Chlaeneas, the Aetolian, at Sparta. In the
autumn of</i>&nbsp;<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;211 <i>the Consul-designate, M. Valerius
Laevinus, induced the Aetolians, Scopas being their Strategus,
to form an alliance with them against Philip. The treaty, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span>
finally concluded, embraced also the Eleans, Lacedaemonians,
King Attalus of Pergamum, the Thracian King Pleuratus, and
the Illyrian Scerdilaidas. A mission was sent from Aetolia to
persuade the Lacedaemonians to join. See Livy</i>, 26, 24.</p>

<p class="tb">&#8220;That the Macedonian supremacy, men of Sparta, was
the beginning of slavery to the Greeks, I am persuaded that
no one will venture to deny; and you may satisfy yourselves
by looking at it thus. There was a league of Greeks living in
the parts towards Thrace who were colonists from Athens and
Chalcis, of which the most conspicuous and powerful was the
city of Olynthus. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;347.</span>
Having enslaved and made
an example of this town, Philip not only became
master of the Thraceward cities, but reduced Thessaly also to
his authority by the terror which he had thus set up. <span class="sidenote">Battle of Chaeronea,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;338.</span>
Not
long after this he conquered the Athenians in
a pitched battle, and used his success with
magnanimity, not from any wish to benefit the
Athenians&mdash;far from it, but in order that his favourable treatment
of them might induce the other states to submit to him
voluntarily. The reputation of your city was still such that
it seemed likely, that, if a proper opportunity arose, it would
recover its supremacy in Greece. Accordingly, without waiting
for any but the slightest pretext, Philip came with his army
and cut down everything standing in your fields, and destroyed
the houses with fire. And at last, after destroying towns and
<span class="sidenote">Succession of
Alexander the
Great, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;336.</span>open country alike, he assigned part of your territory to the
Argives, part to Tegea and Megalopolis,
and
part to the Messenians: determined to benefit
every people in spite of all justice, on the sole
condition of their injuring you. <span class="sidenote">Destruction of
Thebes, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;335.</span>
Alexander succeeded Philip
on the throne, and how he destroyed Thebes,
because he thought that it contained a spark of
Hellenic life, however small, you all I think
know well.</p>

<p><a name="b9_29" id="b9_29"><b>29.</b></a> &#8220;And why need I speak in detail of how the successors
of this king have treated the Greeks? For surely there is
no man living, so uninterested in public affairs, as not to have
heard how Antipater in his victory at Lamia treated the unhappy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
Athenians, as well as the other Greeks; <span class="sidenote">Battle of Crannon,
ending the
Lamian war, 7th
Aug., <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;322.</span>
and how he
went so far in violence and brutality as to institute
man-hunters, and send them to the various
cities to catch all who had ever spoken against,
or in any way annoyed, the royal family of
Macedonia: of whom some were dragged by force from the
temples, and others from the very altars, and put to death
with torture, and others who escaped were forced to leave
Greece entirely; nor had they any refuge save the Aetolian
nation alone. For the Aetolians were the only people in
Greece who withstood Antipater in behalf of those unjustly
defrauded of safety to their lives: they alone faced the invasion
of Brennus and his barbarian army: <span class="sidenote">Defeat of Brennus
at Delphi, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
279. Pausan.
10, 15; 20-23.</span>
and they alone came to your aid when called
upon, with a determination to assist you in
regaining your ancestral supremacy in Greece.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a>
Who again is ignorant of the deeds of Cassander, Demetrius,
and Antigonus Gonatas? For owing to their recency the
knowledge of them still remains distinct. Some of them by
introducing garrisons, and others by implanting despots in the
cities, effectually secured that every state should share the
infamous brand of slavery. But passing by all these I will
now come to the last Antigonus,<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> lest any of you, viewing his
policy unsuspiciously, should consider that you are under an
obligation to the Macedonians. For it was with no purpose
of saving the Achaeans that he undertook the war against
you, nor from any dislike of the tyranny of Cleomenes inducing
him to free the Lacedaemonians. If any man among you
holds this opinion, he must be simple indeed. No! It was
because he saw that his own power would not be secure if
you got the rule of the Peloponnese; and because he saw that
Cleomenes was of a nature well calculated to secure this
object, and that fortune was splendidly seconding your efforts,
that he came in a tumult of fear and jealousy, not to help
Peloponnesians, but to destroy your hopes and abase your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>power. Therefore you do not owe the Macedonians so much
gratitude for not destroying your city when they had taken it,
as hostility and hatred, for having more than once already
stood in your way, when you were strong enough to grasp the
supremacy of Greece.</p>

<p><a name="b9_30" id="b9_30"><b>30.</b></a> &#8220;Again, what need to speak more on the wickedness of
Philip? For of his impiety towards the gods <span class="sidenote">Philip V.</span>
his outrages on the temples at Thermus are a
sufficient proof; and of his cruelty towards man, his perfidy
and treachery to the Messenians.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much for the past. But as to the present resolution
before you, it is in a way necessary to draft it, and vote on it,
as though you were deciding on war, and yet in real truth not
to regard it as a war. For it is impossible for the Achaeans,
beaten as they are, to damage your territory: but I imagine
that they will be only too thankful to heaven if they can but
protect their own, when they find themselves surrounded by
war with Eleans and Messenians as allied to us, and with ourselves
at the same time. And Philip, I am persuaded, will
soon desist from his attack, when involved in a war by land
with Aetolians, and by sea with Rome and King Attalus.
The future may be easily conjectured from the past. For if
he always failed to subdue Aetolians when they were his only
enemies, can we conceive that he will be able to support the
war if all these combine?</p>

<p><a name="b9_31" id="b9_31"><b>31.</b></a> &#8220;I have said thus much with the deliberate purpose of
showing you that you are not hampered by previous engagements,
but are entirely free in your deliberations as to which
you ought to join&mdash;Aetolians or Macedonians. If you are
under an earlier engagement, and have already made up your
minds on these points, what room is there for further argument?
For if you had made the alliance now existing
between yourselves and us, previous to the good services done
you by Antigonus, there might perhaps have been some
reason for questioning whether it were right to neglect an old
treaty in gratitude for recent favours. But since it was
subsequent to this much vaunted freedom and security given
you by Antigonus, and with which they are perpetually
taunting you, that, after deliberation and frequent consideration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>
as to which of the two you ought to join, you decided
to combine with us Aetolians; and have actually exchanged
pledges of fidelity with us, and have fought by our side in the
late war against Macedonia, how can any one entertain a
doubt on the subject any longer? For the obligations of
kindness between you and Antigonus and Philip were
cancelled then. It now remains for you to point out some
subsequent wrong done you by Aetolians, or subsequent
favour by Macedonians: or if neither of these exist, on what
grounds are you now, at the instance of the very men to whom
you justly refused to listen formerly, when no obligation
existed, about to undo treaties and oaths&mdash;the strongest
bonds of fidelity existing among mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such was the conclusion of what was considered a very
cogent speech by Chlaeneas.</p>

<p><a name="b9_32" id="b9_32"><b>32.</b></a> After him the ambassador of the Acarnanians, Lyciscus,
came forward: and at first he paused, seeing the multitude
talking to each other about the last speech; but when at last
silence was obtained, he began his speech as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I and my colleagues, men of Sparta, have been sent to
you by the common league of the Acarnanians; <span class="sidenote">Speech of
Lyciscus, envoy
from Acarnania,
which country was
to fall to the
Aetolians by the
proposed new
treaty. See Livy,
26, 24.</span>
and as we have always shared in the same
prospects as the Macedonians, we consider
that this mission also is common to us and
them. For just as on the field of war, owing to
the superiority and magnitude of the Macedonian
force, our safety is involved in their
valour; so, in the controversies of diplomacy,
our interests are inseparable from the rights of the Macedonians.
Now Chlaeneas in the peroration of his address gave a
summary of the obligations existing between the Aetolians and
yourselves. For he said, &#8216;If subsequent to your making the
alliance with them any fresh injury or offence had been committed
by Aetolians, or any kindness done by Macedonians,
the present proposal ought properly to be discussed as a fresh
start; but that if, nothing of the sort having taken place, we
believe that by quoting the services of Antigonus, and your
former decrees, we shall be able to annul existing oaths and
treaties, we are the greatest simpletons in the world.&#8217; To this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
I reply by acknowledging that I must indeed be the most
foolish of men, and that the arguments I am about to put
forward are indeed futile, if, as he maintains, nothing fresh has
happened, and Greek affairs are in precisely the same position
as before. But if exactly the reverse be the case, as I shall
clearly prove in the course of my speech,&mdash;then I imagine that
I shall be shown to give you some salutary advice, and Chlaeneas
to be quite in the wrong. We are come, then, expressly
because we are convinced that it is needful for us to speak on
this very point: namely, to point out to you that it is at once
your duty and your interest, after hearing of the evils threatening
Greece, to adopt if possible a policy excellent and worthy of
yourselves by uniting your prospects with ours; or if that cannot
be, at least to abstain from this movement for the present.</p>

<p><a name="b9_33" id="b9_33"><b>33.</b></a> &#8220;But since the last speaker has ventured to go back to
ancient times for his denunciations of the Macedonian royal
family, I feel it incumbent on me also to say a few words first
on these points, to remove the misconception of those who have
been carried away by his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chlaenaes said, then, that Philip son of Amyntas became
master of Thessaly by the ruin of Olynthus. But I conceive
that not only the Thessalians, but the other Greeks also, were
preserved by Philip&#8217;s means. <span class="sidenote">Sacred war,

For at the time
when Onomarchus and Philomelus, in defiance
of religion and law seized Delphi and made
themselves masters of the treasury of the god,
who is there among you who does not know
that they collected such a mighty force as no
Greek dared any longer face? Nay, along with
this violation of religion, they were within an ace of becoming
lords of all Greece also. At that crisis Philip volunteered his
assistance; destroyed the tyrants, secured the temple, and
became the author of freedom to the Greeks, as is testified
even to posterity by the facts. <span class="sidenote">Philip elected
generalissimo
against Persia in
the congress of
allies at Corinth,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;338.</span>
For Philip
was unanimously elected general-in-chief by
land and sea, not, as my opponent ventured
to assert, as one who had wronged Thessaly;
but on the ground of his being a benefactor
of Greece: an honour which no one had previously obtained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
&#8216;Ay, but,&#8217; he says, &#8216;Philip came with an armed force into Laconia.&#8217;
Yes, but it was not of his own choice, as you know: he
reluctantly consented to do so, after repeated invitations and
appeals by the Peloponnesians, under the name of their friend
and ally. And when he did come, pray observe, Chlaeneas,
how he behaved. Though he could have availed himself of
the wishes of the neighbouring states for the destruction of these
men&#8217;s territory and the humiliation of their city, and have won
much gratitude too by his act, he by no means lent himself to
such a policy; but, by striking terror into the one and the other
alike, he compelled both parties to accommodate their
differences in a congress, to the common benefit of all: not
putting himself forward as arbitrator of the points in dispute,
but appointing a joint board of arbitration selected from all
Greece. Is that a proceeding which deserves to be held up to
reproach and execration?</p>

<p><a name="b9_34" id="b9_34"><b>34.</b></a> &#8220;Again, you bitterly denounced Alexander, because,
when he believed himself to be wronged, he
punished Thebes: <span class="sidenote">Alexander&#8217;s services
to Greece.</span>
but of his having exacted
vengeance of the Persians for their outrages
on all the Greeks you made no mention at all, nor of
his having released us all in common from heavy miseries,
by enslaving the barbarians, and depriving them of the
supplies which they used for the ruin of the Greeks,&mdash;sometimes
pitting the Athenians against the ancestors of these
gentlemen here, at another the Thebans; nor finally of his
having subjected Asia to the Greeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for Alexander&#8217;s successors how had you the audacity
to mention them? They were indeed, according
to the circumstances of the time, <span class="sidenote">The Diadochi.</span>
on many occasions
the authors of good to some and of harm to others: for
which perhaps others might be allowed to bear them a grudge.
But to <i>you</i> Aetolians it is in no circumstance open to do so,&mdash;you
who have never been the authors of anything good to
any one, but of mischief to many and on many occasions!
<span class="sidenote">The Aetolian

military commanders duly accredited of the sort that you
have? Men that ventured to do violence to the sanctity of
asylum itself! Timaeus violated the sanctuary of Poseidon on
Taenarum, and of Artemis at Lusi. Pharylus and Polycritus
plundered, the former the sacred enclosure of Here in Argos,
the latter that of Poseidon at Mantinea. What again about
Lattabus and Nicostratus? Did not they make a treacherous
attack on the assembly of the Pan-Boeotians in time of peace,
committing outrages worthy of Scythians and Gauls? You
will find no such crimes as these committed by the Diadochi.</p>

<p><a name="b9_35" id="b9_35"><b>35.</b></a> &#8220;Not being able to say anything in defence of
any of these acts, you talk pompously about <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;279.</span>
your having resisted the invasion of Delphi
by the barbarians, and allege that for this Greece ought
to be grateful to you. But if for this one service some gratitude
is owing to the Aetolians; what high honour do the
Macedonians deserve, who throughout nearly their whole
lives are ceaselessly engaged in a struggle with the barbarians
for the safety of the Greeks? For that Greece would have
been continually involved in great dangers, if we had not had
the Macedonians and the ambition of their kings as a barrier,
who is ignorant? <span class="sidenote">Defeat and death
of Ptolemy
Ceraunus in the
battle with the
Gauls,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;280.
See Pausan. 10,
19, 7.</span>
And there is a very striking
proof of this. For no sooner had the Gauls
conceived a contempt for the Macedonians, by
their victory over Ptolemy Ceraunus, than,
thinking the rest of no account, Brennus
promptly marched into the middle of Greece.
And this would often have happened if the
Macedonians had not been on our frontiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, though I have much that I could say on the past,
I think this is enough. Of all the actions of Philip, they have
selected his destruction of the temple, to fasten the charge of
impiety upon him. They did not add a word about their own
outrage and crime, which they perpetrated in regard to the
temples in Dium, and Dodona, and the sacred enclosures of
the gods. The speaker should have mentioned this first.
But anything you Aetolians have suffered you recount to these
gentlemen with exaggeration: but the things you have inflicted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a></span>
unprovoked, though many times as numerous as the others,
you pass over in silence; because you know full well that everybody
lays the blame of acts of injustice and mischief on those
who give the provocation by unjust actions themselves.</p>

<p><a name="b9_36" id="b9_36"><b>36.</b></a> &#8220;Of Antigonus I will only make mention so far, as to
avoid appearing to despise what was done, or to treat as
unimportant so great an undertaking. For my part I think
that history does not contain the record of a more admirable
service than that which Antigonus performed for you: indeed
it appears to me to be unsurpassable. And the following facts
will show this. Antigonus went to war with you and conquered
you in a pitched battle. By force of arms he became master
of your territory and city at once. He might have exercised
all the rights of war upon you: but he was so far from
inflicting any hardships upon you, that, besides other benefits,
he expelled your tyrant and restored your laws and ancestral
constitution. In return for which, in the national assemblies,
calling the Greeks to witness your words, you proclaimed
Antigonus your benefactor and preserver.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then ought to have been your policy? I will speak
what I really think, gentlemen of Sparta: and you will I am sure
bear with me. For I shall do this now from no wish to go out
of my way to bring railing accusations against you, but under
the pressure of circumstances, and for the common good. What
then am I to say? This: that both in the late war you ought to
have allied yourselves not with Aetolians but with Macedonians;
and now again, in answer to these invitations, you ought to join
Philip rather than the former people. But, it may be objected,
you will be breaking a treaty. Which will be the graver
breach of right on your part,&mdash;to neglect a private arrangement
made with Aetolians, or one that has been inscribed on a
column and solemnly consecrated in the sight of all Greece?
On what ground are you so careful of breaking faith with this
people, from whom you have never received any favour, while
you pay no heed to Philip and the Macedonians, to whom
you owe even the very power of deliberating to-day? Do you
regard it as a duty to keep faith with friends? Yet it is not
so much a point of conscience to confirm written pledges of
faith, as it is a violation of conscience to go to war with those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span>
who preserved you: and this is what, in the present instance,
the Aetolians are come to demand of you.</p>

<p><a name="b9_37" id="b9_37"><b>37.</b></a> &#8220;Let it, however, be granted that what I have now said
may in the eyes of severe critics be regarded as beside the
subject. I will now return to the main point at issue, as they
state it. It was this: &#8216;If the circumstances are the same now
as at the time when you made alliance with the Aetolians, then
your policy ought to remain on the same lines.&#8217; That was
their first proposition. &#8216;But if they have been entirely changed,
then it is fair that you should now deliberate on the demands
made to you as on a matter entirely new and unprejudiced.&#8217;
I ask you therefore, Cleonicus and Chlaeneas, who were your
allies on the former occasion when you invited this people to
join you? Were they not all the Greeks? But with whom
are you now united, or to what kind of federation are
you now inviting this people? Is it not to one with the
foreigner? A mighty similarity exists, no doubt, in your
minds, and no diversity at all! <i>Then</i> you were contending for
glory and supremacy with Achaeans and Macedonians, men of
kindred blood with yourselves, and with Philip their leader;
<i>now</i> a war of slavery is threatening Greece against men of
another race, whom you think to bring against Philip, but
have really unconsciously brought against yourselves and all
Greece. For just as men in the stress of war, by introducing
into their cities garrisons superior in strength to their own
forces, while successfully repelling all danger from the enemy,
put themselves at the mercy of their friends,&mdash;just so are the
Aetolians acting in the present case. For in their desire to
conquer Philip and humble Macedonia, they have unconsciously
brought such a mighty cloud from the west, as for the
present perhaps will overshadow Macedonia first, but which in
the sequel will be the origin of heavy evils to all Greece.</p>

<p><a name="b9_38" id="b9_38"><b>38.</b></a> &#8220;All Greeks indeed have need to be on the alert
for the crisis which is coming on: <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;492. Herod.
6, 48; 7, 133.</span>
but Lacedaemonians
above all. For why was it, do you
suppose, men of Sparta, that your ancestors,
when Xerxes sent an ambassador to your town demanding
earth and water, thrust the man into a well, and, throwing
earth upon him, bade him take back word to Xerxes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
that he had got from the Lacedaemonians what he had
demanded from them,&mdash;earth and water? Why was it again, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;480.</span>
do you suppose, that Leonidas and his men
started forth to a voluntary and certain death?
Was it not that they might have the glory of being the
forlorn hope, not only of their own freedom, but of that
of all Greece also? And it would indeed be a worthy action
for descendants of such heroes as these to make a league
with the barbarians now, and to serve with them; and
to war against Epirotes, Achaeans, Acarnanians, Boeotians,
Thessalians, and in fact against nearly every Greek state
except Aetolians! To these last it is habitual to act thus:
and to regard nothing as disgraceful, so long only as it is
accompanied by an opportunity of plunder. It is not so,
however, with you. And what must we expect these people to
do, now that they have obtained the support of the Roman
alliance? For when they obtained an accession of strength
and support from the Illyrians, they at once set about acts of
piracy at sea, and treacherously seized Pylus; while by land
they stormed the city of Cleitor, and sold the Cynaethans into
slavery. Once before they made a treaty with Antigonus, as I
said just now, for the destruction of the Achaean and Acarnanian
races; and now they have done the same with Rome
for the destruction of all Greece.</p>

<p><a name="b9_39" id="b9_39"><b>39.</b></a> &#8220;With a knowledge of such transactions before his eyes
who could help suspecting an attack from Rome, and feeling
abhorrence at the abandoned conduct of the Aetolians in
daring to make such a treaty? They have already wrested
Oeniadae and Nesus from the Acarnanians, and recently
seized the city of the unfortunate Anticyreans, whom, in conjunction
with the Romans, they have sold into slavery.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> Their
children and women are led off by the Romans to suffer all
the miseries which those must expect who fall into the hands
of aliens; while the houses of the unhappy inhabitants are
allotted among the Aetolians. Surely a noble alliance this to
join deliberately! <span class="sidenote">Herod. 7, 132.</span>
Especially for Lacedaemonians:
who, after conquering the barbarians,
decreed that the Thebans, for being the only Greeks that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span>resolved to remain neutral during the Persian invasion, should
pay a tenth of their goods to the gods.</p>

<p>&#8220;The honourable course then, men of Sparta, and the one
becoming your character, is to remember from what ancestors
you are sprung; to be on your guard against an attack from
Rome; to suspect the treachery of the Aetolians. Above all
to recall the services of Antigonus: and so once more show
your loathing for dishonest men; and, rejecting the friendship
of the Aetolians, unite your hopes for the future with those of
Achaia and Macedonia. If, however, any of your own
influential citizens are intriguing against this policy, then at
least remain neutral, and do not take part in the iniquities of
these Aetolians....&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>In the autumn of</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;211, <i>Philip being in Thrace, Scopas

of them bound themselves by a solemn execration never to rejoin
their friends except as conquerors of the invading Aetolians.

<p class="tb"><a name="b9_40" id="b9_40"><b>40.</b></a> When the Acarnanians heard of the intended invasion

<h3>INVESTMENT OF ECHINUS BY PHILIP</h3>

<p><a name="b9_41" id="b9_41"><b>41.</b></a> Having determined to make his approach upon the
town at the two towers, he erected opposite
to them diggers&#8217; sheds and rams; <span class="sidenote">In the campaigns
of Philip, during
the time that
Publius Sulpicius
Galba as Proconsul
commanded
a Roman
fleet in Greek
waters, <i>i.e.</i> from
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;209 to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
206. See Livy,
26, 22, 28; 28,
5-7; 29, 12.</span>
and opposite
the space between the towers he erected
a covered way between the rams, parallel
to the wall. And when the plan was complete,
the appearance of the works was very
like the style of the wall. For the super-structures
on the pent-houses had the appearance
and style of towers, owing to the placing
of the wattles side by side; and the space
between looked like a wall, because the row of
wattles at the top of the covered way were divided into battlements
by the fashion in which they were woven. In the
lowest division of these besieging towers the diggers employed
in levelling inequalities, to allow the stands of the battering-rams
to be brought up, kept throwing on earth, and the ram
was propelled forward: in the second story were water vessels
and other appliances for quenching fires, and along with them
the catapults: and on the third a considerable body of men
were placed to fight with all who tried to damage the rams;
and they were on a level with the city towers. From the
covered way between the besieging towers a double trench
was to be dug towards the wall, between the city towers.
There were also three batteries for stone-throwing machines,
one of which carried stones of a talent weight, and the other
two half that weight. From the camp to the pent-houses and
diggers&#8217; sheds underground tunnels had been constructed,
to prevent men, going to the works from the camp or returning
from the works, being wounded in any way by missiles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>from the town. These works were completed in a very few
days, because the district round produced what was wanted for
this service in abundance. For Echinus is situated on the
Melian Gulf, facing south, exactly opposite the territory of
Thronium, and enjoys a soil rich in every kind of produce;
thanks to which circumstance Philip had no scarcity of anything
he required for his purpose. Accordingly, as I said, as
soon as the works were completed, they begun at once pushing
the trenches and the siege machinery towards the walls....</p>

<p><a name="b9_42" id="b9_42"><b>42.</b></a> While Philip was investing Echinus, and had
secured his position excellently on the side of the town, and
had strengthened the outer line of his camp with a trench and
wall, Publius Sulpicius, the Roman proconsul, <span class="sidenote">Spring of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
209.</span>
and Dorimachus,<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> tegus of the Aetolians,
arrived in person,&mdash;Publius with a fleet, and
Dorimachus with an army of infantry and cavalry,&mdash;and
assaulted Philip&#8217;s entrenchment. Their repulse led to greater
exertions on Philip&#8217;s part in his attack upon the Echinaeans,
who in despair surrendered to him. For Dorimachus was
not able to reduce Philip by cutting off his supplies, as he
got them by sea....</p>

and begged the proconsul to allow
them to send ambassadors to cities of their kinsmen
to obtain ransom. Publius at first returned
a harsh answer, saying, that &#8220;When they were
their own masters was the time that they ought
to have sent ambassadors to their betters to ask for mercy,
not now when they were slaves. A little while ago they had
not thought an ambassador from him worthy of even a word;
now that they were captives they expected to be allowed to
send ambassadors to their kinsfolk: was that not sheer folly?&#8221;
So at the time he dismissed those who came to him with these
words. But next morning he called all the captives together
and said that, as to the Aeginetans, he owed them no favour;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>but for the sake of the rest of the Greeks he would allow
them to send ambassadors to get ransom, since that was the
custom of their country....</p>

<h3>ASIA</h3>

<p><a name="b9_43" id="b9_43"><b>43.</b></a> The Euphrates rises in Armenia and flows through
Syria and the country beyond to Babylonia. It seems to
discharge itself into the Red Sea; but in point of fact it does
not do so: for its waters are dissipated among the ditches dug
across the fields before it reaches the sea. Accordingly the
nature of this river is the reverse of that of others. For in
other rivers the volume of water is increased in proportion to
the greater distance traversed, and they are at their highest in
winter and lowest in midsummer; but this river is fullest of
water at the rising of the dog-star, <span class="sidenote">July 26.</span>
and has the
largest volume of water in Syria, which continually
decreases as it advances. The reason of this is that the
increase is not caused by the collection of winter rains, but by
the melting of the snows; and its decrease by the diversion of
its stream into the land, <span class="sidenote">The transport of
the army of Antiochus
in his eastern
campaigns.
See <i>supra</i>, <b>8</b>, <a href="#b8_25">25</a>.</span>
and its subdivision
for the purposes of irrigation. It was this
which on this occasion made the transport
of the army slow, because as the boats were
heavily laden, and the stream very low, the
forces of the current did exceedingly little to help them
down.</p>

<h3>EMBASSY FROM ROME TO PTOLEMY</h3>

<p><a name="b9_44" id="b9_44"><b>44.</b></a> The Romans sent ambassadors to Ptolemy, wishing
to be supplied with corn, as they were suffering <span class="sidenote">M. Atilius and

from a great scarcity of it at home; and, moreover,
when all Italy had been laid waste by the
enemy&#8217;s troops up to the gates of Rome, and
when all supplies from abroad were stopped by
the fact that war was raging, and armies encamped,
in all parts of the world except in
Egypt. In fact the scarcity at Rome had come to such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
pitch, that a Sicilian medimnus was sold for fifteen drachmae.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a>
But in spite of this distress the Romans did not relax in
their attention to the war.</p>

in his edition of Extracts from Polybius. Still some brief statement of the

Federation could not be altogether omitted here.</p></div>

&#8220;We will destroy no city of the Amphictyony, nor cut off its streams in peace
or war; if any shall do so, we will march against him and destroy his cities;
should any pillage the property of the god, or be privy to or plan anything against
what is in his temple, we will take vengeance on him with hand and foot and
voice and all our might.&#8221; This is indeed the language rather of a Militant
Church than a state; but it is easily conceivable that, had these principles been
carried out (which they were not), something nearer a central and sovereign
parliament might have arisen.</p></div>

with these supplies, recalled Claudius, and forced him to name a Dictator.
Claudius retaliated by naming an obscure person, who was compelled to
abdicate, and then Atilius Calatinus was nominated.</p></div>

twenty-eight books from the expedition of Pyrrhus into the Peloponnese (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>

and therefore probably wrote in a partisan spirit; yet in the matter of the
outrage upon Mantinea, Polybius himself is not free from the same charge.
See Mueller&#8217;s <i>Histor. Graec.</i> fr. lxxvii.-lxxxi. Plutarch, though admitting
Phylarchus&#8217;s tendency to exaggeration (<i>Arat.</i> 38), yet uses his authority both
in his life of Aratus and of Cleomenes; and in the case of Aristomachus says
that he was both racked and drowned (<i>Arat.</i> 44).</p></div>

the battle, see W. T. Arnold&#8217;s edition of Dr. Arnold&#8217;s <i>History of the Second
Punic War</i>, pp. 384-393. The radical difference between the account of
Livy and that of Polybius seems to be that the former conceives the fighting
to have been on the north shore of the lake between Tucro and Passignano;
Polybius conceives the rear to have been caught in the defile of Passignano,
the main fighting to have been more to the east, where the road turns up at
right angles to the lake by La Torricella. Mr. Capes, however in his note on
the passage of Livy, seems to think that both accounts agree in representing
the fighting on the vanguard as being opposite Tucro.</p></div>

warfare even in those days, and seems to have been the true ground for the
charge of <i>crudelitas</i> always attributed to Hannibal by Roman writers, as opposed
to the behaviour of such an enemy as Pyrrhus (Cic. <i>de Am.</i> 28). It
may be compared to the order of the Convention to give no quarter to

was connected with the worship of Apollo brought from Megara, M&uuml;ller&#8217;s

states, but the audit of a Consul seems to have been one of money accounts
only. At the expiration, however, of his office he took an oath in public that he
had obeyed the laws, and if any prosecution were brought against him it would
be tried before the people. See the case of Publius Claudius, <b>1</b>, <a href="#b1_52">52</a>.</p></div>

invariably composed of Senators. The same would apply to the <i>Quaestiones
perpetuae</i>, only one of which existed in the time of Polybius, i.e., <i>de repetundis</i>,
established in 149 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;by the lex Calpurnia. Other single judices in civil
suits, though nominated by the Praetor, were, Polybius intimates, almost
necessarily Senators in cases of importance.</p></div>

states that the ordinary number of cavalry was 200, raised in cases of emergency
to 300, and Livy, 22, 36, gives an instance. But both authors in

is rejected (1) as not being a mixed one, (2) as not having been successful:
successful, that is, in gaining or keeping an empire. He is speaking somewhat
loosely. The power of Athens, of which Themistocles laid the foundation,
was mainly consolidated by Pericles; so that Polybius includes much of the
period of her rise with that of her decline.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_307" id="Footnote_307"></a><a href="#FNanchor_307"><span class="label">307</span></a> This equality of land had gradually disappeared by the time of King
Agis IV. (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;243-239): so that, according to Plutarch [<i>Agis</i> 5], the number
of landowners was reduced to 100. This process had been accelerated by the
Rhetra of Epitadeus, allowing free bequest of land, Plutarch, <i>ib.</i> See Thirlwall,
vol. viii. p. 132.</p></div>

recognised position,&#8221; is at least doubtful. Casaubon translates it <i>qui in
album non fuerint recepti</i>, referring to Sueton. Nero, 21. But nothing is elsewhere
known of such an <i>album</i> for registering the names of recognised athletes.
The passage is important as helping to explain how the number of those entering
for the contests in the greater games was practically limited, and therefore
how it happened that, for instance, the five contests of the Pentathlum did not
often fall to different athletes so as to leave the victory uncertain.</p></div>

pins corresponding with those that fall into the bolt (the &#946;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#953;), and which
are pushed up by it. It was thus used as a key which could be taken out
and kept by the Commandant, as in Herod. 3, 155; Thucyd. 2, 4. But
Polybius here seems to use it as equivalent to &#946;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;. See Aeneas, <i>Tact.</i> 18-20,
who recommends that the &#956;&#8057;&#967;&#955;&#959;&#962; should be sheeted with iron to prevent this
very operation. Cp. 4, 57. What he means by &#950;&#8059;&#947;&#969;&#956;&#945; on the outside (here
translated &#8220;fastenings&#8221;) is also somewhat doubtful. From Hesychius, s.v.
&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#958;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#8053;&#961;, it might be conjectured that chains of some kind were intended.

their name.</p></div>

ancients; and certainly spitting blood would be no conclusive evidence of
the presence of poison. See Creighton&#8217;s <i>History of the Papacy</i>, vol. iv.
